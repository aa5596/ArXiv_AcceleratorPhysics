  "title": "Optimal Landau-type closure parameters for two-fluid simulations of   plasma turbulence at kinetic scales",
  "abstract": "Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.",
