  "title": "Chromatic Calorimetry -- A Novel Approach to Validate Energy Resolution   and Particle Discrimination",
  "abstract": "Chromatic calorimetry (CCAL) analyses particle detection by utilizing scintillators with distinct emission wavelengths to measure the longitudinal energy deposition of particle showers in high-energy physics, improving particle identification (PID) and energy resolution. By stacking scintillators in order of decreasing emission wavelength, CCAL enables layer-specific energy measurements, analyzed via amplitude fractions ($f_i = A_i / \\sum_j A_j$) and center of gravity ($\\langle z_{\\text{cog}} \\rangle = \\sum_i z_i E_i / \\sum_i E_i$). This thesis presents results from two CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) experiments conducted in 2023 and 2024, complemented by GEANT4 simulations of a quantum dot (QD)-based CCAL design, to validate its potential for future colliders such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC).",
