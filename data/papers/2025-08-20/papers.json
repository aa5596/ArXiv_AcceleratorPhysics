    "title": "Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins",
    "abstract": "Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.",

    "title": "Eliminating Tokamak Disruptions with Feedback",
    "abstract": "Many disruptions are caused by resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM). A database of DIII-D locked mode disruptions provides two main disruption criteria, which are shown to be signatures of RWTMs. The first is that the q = 2 rational surface must be sufficiently close the resistive wall surrounding the plasma to interact with it. If active feedback is used, this implies that RWTMs can be prevented from causing major disruptions. This is demonstrated in simulations. The second criterion is that the current profile is sufficiently peaked. This is caused by edge cooling, such as by impurity radiation and turbulence, which suppress edge current and temperature. This implies the disruptions are not caused by neoclassical tearing modes (NTM), because the bootstrap current is also suppressed. At high $\\beta,$ resistive wall modes (RWM) can be stabilized with feedback. Feedback also stabilizes high $\\beta$ RWTMs, as shown in NSTX data and in simulations. These results suggest that RWTM disruptions in ITER might be prevented using the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) coils.",

    "title": "Current sheet formation under radiative cooling",
    "abstract": "We present a simple, analytically solvable MHD model of current sheet formation through X-point collapse under optically thin radiative cooling. Our results show that cooling accelerates the collapse of the X-point along the inflows, but strong cooling can arrest or even reverse the current sheet elongation in the outflow direction. Hence, we detail a modification to the radiatively-cooled Sweet-Parker model developed by Uzdensky & McKinney (2011) to allow for varying current sheet length. The steady-state solution shows that when radiative cooling dominates compressional heating, the current sheet length is shorter than the system size, with an increased reconnection rate compared to the classical Sweet-Parker rate. The model and subsequent results lay out the groundwork for a more complete theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in regimes dominated by optically thin radiative cooling.",

    "title": "Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab   Laser Accelerator",
    "abstract": "We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.",

Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces.

This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Helicon plasmas are being considered as plasma sources for wakefield accelerators, subject to strict density requirements. We present various mechanisms to increase axial density homogeneity in a helicon plasma for implementation in such an accelerator. We consider various background neutral flow configurations for helicons generated with first one antenna and then two identical antennas in a 2 meter long, 52 mm diameter plasma chamber with homogeneous magnetic field. In the case of a single antenna, the ionization source rate and density profiles are not significantly influenced by the background neutral flow. The use of a second antenna expands the plasma axially along the device, and results in an increased dependence of the axial density profile on the background neutral flow. We find an increase in axial homogeneity by a factor of two when there is no background neutral flow compared to when there is flow in either direction relative to the plasma. The minimum axial density deviation accomplished by optimization of RF antenna and neutral flow was 5%. This is still a factor of 20 above the nominal homogeneity requirement, but means to further improve this have been established in this study.",

This includes a method to construct suitable magnetic axis curves by solving Frenet-Serret equations, and an approach to controlling magnetic surface shaping at first order (plasma elongation), which previously has required careful parameter selection or additional optimization steps. The approach is suitable for studying different classes of quasi-isodynamic stellarators including different axis ``helicities'' and topologies (e.g. knotted solutions), and as the basis for future systematic surveys using higher order near-axis theory. As an example application, we explore a family of configurations with per-field-period axis helicity equal to one half, demonstrating an approximate scaling symmetry relating different field period numbers.",

    "abstract": "Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.",

    "abstract": "Rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) are essential for quick selection of effective drugs to treat bacterial infections at an early stage. However, the most widely used phenotypic ASTs in clinical practice often require 24 - 48 hours of pre-culture enrichment and 8 - 20 hours of testing. They are too slow for patients to wait for therapy, even with the most rapid protocol. Here, we report a lab-on-a-silicon chip (LOSC) system, which integrates arrays of silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNWFET) sensors with high-throughput cell-collection microfluidics for rapid ASTs. The microfluidics concentrate bacteria into picoliter-scale chambers within minutes, eliminating the need for any pre-cultivation. Embedded SiNWFETs sensitively track antibiotic-induced metabolic pH shifts. Using an unbuffered culturing medium, LOSC achieves sample-to-result times within 20 minutes for clinically isolated E. coli strains. With its electrical readout and compact design, LOSC offers a low-cost, rapid, and portable AST solution for point-of-care diagnostics.",

    "title": "From plasma to pattern: observation and characterization of periodic   structure formation in dielectric breakdown channels of electron-irradiated   insulators",
    "abstract": "Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.",

The detector and acquisition system tested was shown to provide accurate flux measurements up to an instantaneous dose rate of about 7.5 Gy/s. Above this, there is an efficiency loss due to multiple protons crossing the detector, which could be addressed through a redesign of the sensors and electronics. LGADs therefore offer a viable alternative for proton therapy beam diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "We calculate transport coefficients from the Chapman--Enskog expansion with BGK collision operators, obtaining exactly $\\kappa = \\frac{5nT}{2m\\nu}$, and show that maximum entropy closure yields identical results when applied with the same collision operator. Through structural arguments, we suggest that this $1/\\nu$ divergence extends to other local collision operators of the form $\\mathcal{L} = \\nu\\hat{L}$, making the divergence fundamental to the Chapman--Enskog approach rather than a closure artifact. To address this limitation, we propose a phenomenological effective collision frequency $\\nu_{\\eff} = \\nu\\sqrt{1 + \\Kn^2}$ motivated by gradient-driven decorrelation, where $\\Kn$ is the Knudsen number. We verify that this regularization maintains conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency while yielding finite transport coefficients across all collisionality regimes. Comparison with exact solutions of a bounded kinetic model shows similar functional form, providing limited validation of our approach. This work provides explicit calculation of a known divergence problem in kinetic theory and offers one phenomenological regularization method with transparent treatment of mathematical assumptions versus physical approximations.",

    "title": "Inverse Weak measurement in SERF magnetometer",
    "abstract": "Weak measurement techniques have been extensively applied in the field of quantum precision measurement to detect ultra-small signals due to the amplification effect. In this work, we propose an optical detection system for a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on the inverse weak measurement (IWM) framework. By using the spatial pattern of a probe laser as the measurement pointer, we successfully detect ultra-weak magnetic fields. In our model, the spatial pattern of the probe laser is weakly coupled to its polarization, which is sensitive to external magnetic fields. Through post-selection on the optical polarization, the ultra-small magnetic field is significantly amplified with the amplification factor inversely proportional to the coupling strength, as reflected in the measured displacement of the final spatial pattern. By analysing the response curve of the probe laser displacement to the magnetic field, we identify the point of maximum sensitivity, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity of 182.8 fT/Hz1/2. Furthermore, in the IWM scheme, the detected signals depend only on the internal degrees of freedom of the probe laser, making the system robust against the fluctuations in laser power. To demonstrate this advantage, we compute the Allan standard deviation of the output signals for both conventional and IWM detection methods. The results indicate that the IWM-based method improves stability of detection by one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents a novel detection approach that integrates weak measurement techniques, offering a significant enhancement in the performance of SERF magnetometers.",

    "title": "Reconfigurable miniaturized computational spectrometer enabled by   photoelastic effect",
    "abstract": "Miniatured computational spectrometers, distinguished by their compact size and lightweight, have shown great promise for on-chip and portable applications in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, food safety, and industrial process monitoring. However, the common miniaturization strategies predominantly rely on advanced micro-nano fabrication and complex material engineering, limiting their scalability and affordability. Here, we present a broadband miniaturized computational spectrometer (ElastoSpec) by leveraging the photoelastic effect for easy-to-prepare and reconfigurable implementations. A single computational photoelastic spectral filter, with only two polarizers and a plastic sheet, is designed to be integrated onto the top of a CMOS sensor for snapshot spectral acquisition. The different spectral modulation units are directly generated from different spatial locations of the filter, due to the photoelastic-induced chromatic polarization effect of the plastic sheet. We experimentally demonstrate that ElastoSpec offers excellent reconstruction accuracy for the measurement of both simple narrowband and complex spectra. It achieves a full width at half maximum (FWHM) error of approximately 0.2 nm for monochromatic inputs, and maintains a mean squared error (MSE) value on the order of 10^-3 with only 10 spectral modulation units. Furthermore, we develop a reconfigurable strategy for enhanced spectra sensing performance through the flexibility in optimizing the modulation effectiveness and the number of spectral modulation units. This work avoids the need for complex micro-nano fabrication and specialized materials for the design of computational spectrometers, thus paving the way for the development of simple, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for on-chip and portable spectral sensing devices.",

    "abstract": "A study of antiproton-nucleus annihilations at rest on a variety of thin solid targets using slow extracted antiprotons is being prepared. To detect the charged annihilation products, the experiment will employ seven Timepix4 ASICs coupled to 500 um thick silicon sensors. These will be arranged in a cuboid geometry that covers the majority of the full solid angle around the target, enabling precise tracking of outgoing particles using only one layer of detectors. With these novel chips, the annihilation will be studied by measuring the total multiplicity, energy, and angular distribution of various prongs produced in a number of targets. A 3D reconstruction algorithm for determining the annihilation vertex from particle tracks in the single-plane detectors has been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. This allows for event-by-event reconstruction, making it possible to distinguish antiproton annihilations on the target from those occurring elsewhere. The measurements will also enable a study of possible final state interactions triggered by the primary annihilation mesons, their evolution with the nuclear mass and their branching ratios.",

    "title": "A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination",
    "abstract": "Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning. This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial resolution ($\\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\\% RSP accuracy. With proton count requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol (0.16~mGy, $2\\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\\% RSP accuracy and $\\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements, this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation for future pCT systems.",

    "title": "Simulation Study of Energy Chirp Induced Effects in Laser Wakefield   Accelerator Driven Free Electron Laser",
    "abstract": "Beam energy compression via chicane magnets has been proved to be an effective method to reduce the slice energy spread of electron beams generated by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs). This technique has been widely adopted by leading research teams in experiments targeting future compact, high-gain free electron lasers (FELs). However, after energy compression, a strong beam energy chirp is introduced into the electron beam, which substantially hinders the microbunching process and impairs spectral coherence. Here, we present a detailed, unaveraged three-dimensional simulation that examines the effects of this energy chirp, and the results can be applied to the design of a proposed LWFA-driven VUV FEL. The energy chirp in a LWFA-produced electron beam causes FEL interactions at multiple resonant frequencies across the entire electron bunch, simultaneously, which prevents sustained radiation power growth at the designed frequency along the undulator. Consequently, spectral purity is significantly degraded. Additionally, due to undulator dispersion, the energy chirp leads to an elongation of the bunch length, which increases microbunch separation. This results in a noticeable redshift in the radiation frequency and further disruption of spectral purity. These effects are compared to the ideal scenario in which the energy chirp is removed following energy compression. Simulation results indicate that the implementation of a beam dechirper is a crucial step for improving the saturation of radiation power. Insights gained from this simulation of energy chirp-induced mechanisms will aid in the development of more effective compensation strategies, ultimately optimizing LWFA-driven FEL designs.",

    "title": "Controlling the recovery time of the superconducting nanowire   single-photon detector with a voltage-controlled cryogenic tunable resistor",
    "abstract": "Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), owing to their unique performance, are currently the standard detector in most demanding single-photon experiments. One important metric for any single-photon detector is the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation between consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more subtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the temporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it increases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is dominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of saturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or increasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process. Significant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a series resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector latching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and hence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated passive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on trial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using a novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can find the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while maintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of more than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable detection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as high as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency.",

SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.",

    "title": "Multiphysics Analysis of Cryogenically Cooled Photocathode in a CW SRF   Injector cavity",
    "abstract": "The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at 5 W incident laser power reaches a weak thermal limit, thereby establishing a design constraint and requires further optimization.",

    "title": "Polarized Emission of Intrabinary Shocks in Spider Pulsars from Global   3D Kinetic Simulations",
    "abstract": "In spider pulsar systems, a relativistic intrabinary shock forms when the pulsar wind collides with the massive outflow driven off the pulsar's low-mass stellar companion. The shock is a site of non-thermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar intrabinary shocks and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At $90^\\circ$ inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree $\\gtrsim15\\%$, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of turbulence in the boundary region of a tokamak is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of fusion reactors. In this work, the use of low-rank linear algebra techniques is shown to enhance the efficiency of boundary simulations, specifically by accelerating the solution of a kinetic model for the neutral particles. Solving the kinetic model deterministically using the method of characteristics requires the solution of integral equations, which typically result in dense linear systems upon discretization. We employ hierarchical matrix approximations to significantly reduce the computational cost of assembling and solving the linear systems, leading to substantial savings in both time and memory. The hierarchical matrix method is implemented and tested within the GBS simulation code for boundary simulations, achieving over 90\\% reduction in computation time and memory, and enabling simulations with unprecedented spatial resolution for neutral particles.",

    "title": "Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting   electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend",
    "abstract": "Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with 50 dB of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (200 MHz vs. 80 MHz).",

    "abstract": "Experiments on ADITYA-U tokamak show a marked enhancement in the sawtooth period by application of short gas puffs of fuel that cause a modification of the radial density profile. A consequent suppression of the trapped electron modes (TEMs) then leads to an increase in the core electron temperature. This slows down the heat propagation following a sawtooth crash, causing a delay in achieving the critical temperature gradient inside the q = 1 surface required for the next sawtooth crash to happen. The overall scenario has strong similarities with the behavior of sawtooth under electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). Our findings suggest an alternate, simpler technique for sawtooth control that may be usefully employed in small/medium-sized tokamaks that do not have an ECRH or any other auxiliary heating facility.",

    "abstract": "Detectors in next-generation high-energy physics experiments face several daunting requirements, such as high data rates, damaging radiation exposure, and stringent constraints on power, space, and latency. To address these challenges, machine learning in readout electronics can be leveraged for smart detector designs, enabling intelligent inference and data reduction at-source. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a variety of benefits for front-end readout; an on-sensor encoder can perform efficient lossy data compression while simultaneously providing a latent space representation that can be used for anomaly detection. Results are presented from low-latency and resource-efficient VAEs for front-end data processing in a futuristic silicon pixel detector. Encoder-based data compression is found to preserve good performance of off-detector analysis while significantly reducing the off-detector data rate as compared to a similarly sized data filtering approach. Furthermore, the latent space information is found to be a useful discriminator in the context of real-time sensor defect monitoring. Together, these results highlight the multifaceted utility of autoencoder-based front-end readout schemes and motivate their consideration in future detector designs.",

    "abstract": "We study a rain-powered energy-harvesting device inspired by the natural impact of raindrops on leaves. In nature, a raindrop striking a leaf at high speed causes it to deform and vibrate. Inspired by this, our device uses an elastic beam coupled with a piezoelectric material to convert mechanical vibrations from droplet impacts into electrical energy. We conduct experiments to analyze how beam length, droplet impact location, and residual droplet mass affect energy conversion. Our results, supported by a theoretical model, show strong agreement when the beam length exceeds 5 cm. Beyond this length, the energy conversion becomes independent of further increases, suggesting that 5 cm is optimal for maximizing output. To validate practical applicability, we also test the device under real rain conditions, demonstrating consistent performance. Understanding the interplay between raindrop dynamics and energy conversion can guide the design of efficient, scalable rain-powered energy-harvesting systems for environmental applications.",

    "abstract": "Precision detection of neutrino-nucleus interactions in water with the complete detection of the final state, including leptons and hadrons, is challenging due to water being a non-scintillating medium. This can be a limitation for the next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, where the neutrino-nucleus interaction models must reach a few percent-level accuracy. Water-based liquid scintillator can be a game changer for the future near detectors. In this article, we propose a novel design consisting of a 3D highly-segmented water-based liquid scintillator. The water-based liquid scintillator is encapsulated within a highly-segmented rigid but very light structure that provides the optical isolation with a 1 cm$^{3}$ granularity, each read out by orthogonal wavelength shifting fibers, and 81\\% of water by mass in the active volume. Such configuration is also suitable for pure liquid scintillator. The detector design, prototyped and validated with cosmic ray data, is described and results are reported. The optical model is studied with Monte Carlo simulations and results are compared with the collected data.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.",

    "abstract": "Preformed plasma channels are essential for guiding high-power laser pulses over extended distances in laser wakefield accelerators, enabling the generation of multi-GeV electron beams for applications such as free-electron lasers and particle colliders. Above-threshold ionization heating provides a robust mechanism for creating laser-matched plasma channels across a wide parameter range, owing to its density- and geometry-independent heating effect. Establishing predictive scaling laws between channel parameters and formation conditions is critical for designing channels optimized for electron acceleration across energies spanning hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV. Through combined timescale analysis and numerical simulations, hydrodynamic expansion is identified as the dominant mechanism governing density profile evolution during ATI channel formation. Remarkably, this process maintains effective laser-guiding channel structures across a wide range of initial gas density, as evidenced by the persistent profile similarity observed despite these significant parameter variations. For parabolic channels matched to Gaussian laser drivers, rigorous scaling laws are established that, the on-axis density scales linearly with the initial gas density, while the matching radius has an exponential dependence on both the initial gas density and the ionization laser radius. These findings provide a systematic framework for the predictive design and optimization of plasma channels in high-efficiency and high-energy LWFA applications.",

    "abstract": "Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.",

    "title": "High-Fidelity Data-Driven Dynamics Model for Reinforcement   Learning-based Control in HL-3 Tokamak",
    "abstract": "The success of reinforcement learning (RL)-based control in tokamaks, an emerging technique for controlled nuclear fusion with improved flexibility, typically requires substantial interaction with a simulator capable of accurately evolving the high-dimensional plasma state. Compared to first-principle-based simulators, whose intense computations lead to sluggish RL training, we devise an effective method to acquire a fully data-driven simulator, by mitigating the arising compounding error issue due to the underlying autoregressive nature. With high accuracy and appealing extrapolation capability, this high-fidelity dynamics model subsequently enables the rapid training of a qualified RL agent to directly generate engineering-reasonable actuator commands, aiming at the desired long-term targets of plasma configuration. Together with a surrogate model for Equilibrium Fitting code based on neural network, named EFITNN, the RL agent successfully maintains a 400-ms, 1 kHz trajectory control with accurate waveform tracking of plasma current and last closed flux surface on the HL-3 tokamak. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the feasibility of zero-shot adaptation to changed triangularity targets, confirming the robustness of the developed data-driven dynamics model. Our work underscores the advantage of fully data-driven dynamics models in yielding RL-based trajectory control policies at a sufficiently fast pace, an anticipated engineering requirement in daily discharge practices for the upcoming ITER device.",

    "title": "Pump with broadband probe experiments for single-shot measurements of   plasma conditions and crossed-beam energy transfer",
    "abstract": "A novel technique for measuring plasma conditions using monochromatic pump-broadband probe laser interactions has been experimentally demonstrated. Originally proposed in [J. Ludwig et al., Phys. Plasmas \\textbf{26}, 113108 (2019)], this method utilizes crossed-beam energy transfer between the broadband probe and the pump, mediated by plasma ion acoustic waves. The complete energy transfer spectrum can be captured in a single shot, enabling the inference of plasma parameters such as density, electron and ion temperatures, and flow velocity. Compared to Thomson scattering, this technique offers signal enhancements typically larger than 9 orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the required probe laser intensity and facilitating interactions that are linear and measurements that are non-perturbative of the plasma. Furthermore, it provides a powerful tool for advancing studies of crossed-beam energy transfer under conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments.",

    "title": "Generation of Ultrabrilliant Positron Beam via Superponderomotive   Injection in Laser Wakefield Acceleration",
    "abstract": "Plasma-based acceleration of positrons attracts extensive interests due to the ultrahigh accelerating gradient and ultrashort duration, while generating wakefield positron beam by the inherent injection is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a superponderomotive injection method of positrons in the blowout regime of laser wakefield acceleration. In this method, transverse laser fields facilitate the trapping of positrons into the laser-modulated longitudinal wakefield which dominates the subsequent energy gaining, that is distinct from the electrostatic induced superponderomotive electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this method can be implemented by the collision between a donut wake and a pair jet, resulting in the multi-cycle positron beam with hundreds of pC charge and brightness of $10^{13}~\\rm{Am}^{-2}$. Such a collisional setup is available in the current laser-plasma experiments, and the generated positron beam is favorable for developing next generation of electron-positron collider, modeling the laboratory astrophysics and performing the ultrafast material diagnostics research.",

    "title": "Particle identification in the GlueX detector with machine learning",
    "abstract": "In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both MLPs and BDTs can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap between Collisional and Collisionless Plasma Shocks: A   Simulation Study using OSIRIS",
    "abstract": "Shock waves in plasmas can be characterized by the mechanisms behind their formation. When binary collisions are frequent, dissipation is collision-driven and the shock width is a few mean free paths. In contrast, collisionless shocks rely on collective plasma processes to establish dissipation on scales well below the mean free path. We bridge these regimes with particle-in-cell simulations using OSIRIS with a Coulomb-collision module, varying parameters that control collisionality. We find a smooth transition of the shock width in the intermediate region where the ion plasma parameter $N_D \\approx 1$. Our results recover the asymptotic predictions: a collisional-regime width consistent with the Mott-Smith ansatz with a BGK operator, and the collisionless limit consistent with Tidman's classical formalism. The ion plasma parameter thus serves as a practical metric for identifying when shocks shift from fluid-like, mean-free-path scales to collisionless, sub-mean-free-path scales. We discuss implications for astrophysical environments, where shock breakout changes the shock width and marks the onset of efficient particle acceleration.",
