    "title": "Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC",
    "abstract": "This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These models are characterized by a distinguished direction following the magnetic field around the torus, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD uses 2D, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the 3D, extended MHD code M3D-C1 uses 2D, unstructured C1 elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction and a regular grid that is partially aligned with the magnetic field. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which NIMROD does at the formulation level, but M3D-C1 uses a full 3D discretization. The resulting algebraic system is solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the M3D-C1 velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC - Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation - block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC4 disruption, and the next steps in the development of this solver are outlined.",

    "title": "Nyström Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged   Particle Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\\\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\\\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\\\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.",

    "title": "Analysis of RF Surface Loss in a Planar 2D Qubit",
    "abstract": "The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence time of a qubit effectively sets the \"lifetime\" of usable quantum information, determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.",

    "title": "Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and   plasma density for laser-plasma experiments",
    "abstract": "Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration is motivated as a weak form to implement general covariance and a generalized form of Einstein's equivalence principle from a physical point of view and the fundamental geometric and kinematic properties of such spaces are discussed. Thereafter the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particles in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to the model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $4.8\\cdot 10^{10}/N$ K for current high acceleration electron laser-plasma acceleration systems, where $N$ is the population of the typical bunch.",

    "title": "Gravitational Turbulence: the Small-Scale Limit of the Cold-Dark-Matter   Power Spectrum",
    "abstract": "The matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, is one of the fundamental quantities in the study of large-scale structure in cosmology. Here, we study its small-scale asymptotic limit, and show that for cold dark matter in $d$ spatial dimensions, $P(k)$ has a universal $k^{-d}$ asymptotic scaling with the wave-number $k$, for $k \\gg k_{\\rm nl}$, where $k_{\\rm nl}^{-1}$ denotes the length scale at which non-linearities in gravitational interactions become important. We propose a theoretical explanation for this scaling, based on a non-perturbative analysis of the system's phase-space structure. Gravitational collapse is shown to drive a turbulent phase-space flow of the quadratic Casimir invariant, where the linear and non-linear time scales are balanced, and this balance dictates the $k$ dependence of the power spectrum. A parallel is drawn to Batchelor turbulence in hydrodynamics, where large scales mix smaller ones via tidal interactions. The $k^{-d}$ scaling is also derived by expressing $P(k)$ as a phase-space integral in the framework of kinetic field theory, which is analysed by the saddle-point method; the dominant critical points of this integral are precisely those where the time scales are balanced. The coldness of the dark-matter distribution function - its non-vanishing only on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold of phase-space - underpins both approaches. The theory is accompanied by $1\\mathrm{D}$ Vlasov-Poisson simulations, which confirm it.",

    "abstract": "The efficient tagging of individual muons, along with the stability of the involved ultrathin carbon foil, is critical for ensuring fast, reliable and reproducible low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\\mathrm{\\mu}$SR) measurements. At the Paul Scherrer Institute's Low-Energy Muon (LEM) beamline, we developed a method to monitor the tagging efficiency of the beamline using routinely collected muon decay histograms. This method leverages background comparison before and after the arrival time of the muons at the sample to extract the tagging efficiency, eliminating the need for additional detectors or measurements. By analyzing data collected between 2018 and 2024, we confirm the method's reliability and validate its results using independent reference measurements. Furthermore, we establish a correlation between the tagging efficiency and foil thickness by investigating the impact of contamination and outgassing on the carbon foil, as well as the restoration effects of laser cleaning. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring the carbon foil's condition to maintain consistent beamline performance and reproducibility. This method offers a practical approach for detector efficiency monitoring, applicable to other beamlines employing similar setups.",

Owing to the extremely small beam size, the luminosity is highly sensitive to the stability of final focusing elements, where mechanical vibrations (e.g. ground motion) may induce beam offsets and luminosity degradation. To address this, a luminosity-driven dithering system is implemented for horizontal beam stabilization. In this work, we develop an optimized 4H-SiC fast luminosity detector scheme using an array of radiation detectors with picosecond time resolution positioned at critical locations. By using self-development software RAdiation SEmiconductoR (RASER), we optimize the active area of the detector to achieve 2\\% relative precision at 1~kHz. Furthermore, the Total Sample Current (TSC) exhibits a near-linear correlation with luminosity attenuation, enabling real-time luminosity monitoring.",

    "title": "Scintillation characteristics of an undoped CsI crystal at   low-temperature for dark matter search",
    "abstract": "The scintillation characteristics of 1 g undoped CsI crystal were studied by directly coupling two silicon photomultipliers(SiPMs) over a temperature range from room temperature to 86 K. The scintillation decay time and light output were measured using x-ray and gamma-ray peaks from a 109Cd radioactive source. An increase in decay time was observed as the temperature decreased from room temperature to 86 K, ranging from 76 ns to 605 ns. The light output also increased, reaching 26.2 +/- 1.3 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent at 86 K. Leveraging the significantly enhanced scintillation light output of the undoped CsI crystal at low temperatures, coupling it with SiPMs results in a promising detector for rare event searches. Both cesium and iodine have an odd number of protons, making them suitable targets for probing dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of the proposed detector to such interactions, incorporating the Migdal effect and assuming 200 kg of undoped CsI crystals for dark matter searches. The results indicate that undoped CsI coupled with SiPM can achieve world-competitive sensitivity for low-mass dark matter detection, particularly in the context of dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions.",

    "abstract": "Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.",

    "abstract": "High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase ($\\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for high-accuracy applications.",

    "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) particle detectors have the potential to provide time resolutions and robust performance in extreme environments which exceed that of silicon detectors. In this work 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) and complementary PiN diodes were irradiated with 2.5 GeV protons at fluences up to 3.33$\\times$10$^{14}$ p/cm$^2$. The electrostatic performance of both irradiated and non-irradiated devices was evaluated using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Moreover, charge collection measurements using $\\alpha$ particles were also conducted. SiC LGADs displayed a loss in rectification and gain with increasing proton fluence. Additionally, the reduction in capacitance and OFF-state current pointed to compensation of the gain layer as a gain reducing mechanism. The introduction of radiation induced defects also hinders carrier acceleration reducing impact ionization, leading to further gain reduction. However, despite the reduction in device performance, the demonstration of a measurable signal and gain after irradiation points to the potential of SiC LGAD detectors for future high energy physics applications.",

    "title": "Characterization of spurious-electron signals in the double-phase argon   TPC of the DarkSide-50 experiment",
    "abstract": "Spurious-electron signals in dual-phase noble-liquid time projection chambers have been observed in both xenon and argon Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). This paper presents the first comprehensive study of spurious electrons in argon, using data collected by the DarkSide-50 experiment at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). Understanding these events is a key factor in improving the sensitivity of low-mass dark matter searches exploiting ionization signals in dual-phase noble liquid TPCs.   We find that a significant fraction of spurious-electron events, ranging from 30 to 70% across the experiment's lifetime, are caused by electrons captured from impurities and later released with delays of order 5-50 ms. The rate of spurious-electron events is found to correlate with the operational condition of the purification system and the total event rate in the detector. Finally, we present evidence that multi-electron spurious electron events may originate from photo-ionization of the steel grid used to define the electric fields. These observations indicate the possibility of reduction of the background in future experiments and hint at possible spurious electron production mechanisms.",

    "title": "General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic   Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers",
    "abstract": "Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger & Field and Finn & Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.",

    "title": "Axisymmetric Gyrokinetic Simulation of ASDEX-Upgrade Scrape-off Layer   Using a Conservative Implicit BGK Collision Operator",
    "abstract": "Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion plasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain of interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can become overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to high computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have implemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll framework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time integrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time step in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure conservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme to correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian distribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further generalized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction routine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and conservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more computationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has been utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables 2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56 times faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because the BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is required by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we demonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK operator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally expensive LBD operator.",

    "title": "Characterization of mini-CryoCube detectors from the Ricochet experiment   commissioning at the Institut Laue-Langevin",
    "abstract": "The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.",

    "title": "A Flare-related Decimetric Type-IV Radio Burst Induced by the X2   Radiation of Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission",
    "abstract": "The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we analyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong levels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the emission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with well-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are left-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The sources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic electrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone distribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.",

    "title": "A visual approach to global accretion disk instabilities",
    "abstract": "For over 30 years, the Magneto-Rotational Instability has been accepted as the mechanism driving accretion disk turbulence. Its physical basis is well understood, where an interplay between centrifugal forces and magnetic tension transfers angular momentum between oppositely displaced fluid elements. In this work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the Super-Alfv\\'enic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source \\texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways. We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.",

    "title": "Towards a Robust Model-Independent Test of the DAMA/LIBRA Dark Matter   Signal: ANAIS-112 Results with Six Years of Data",
    "abstract": "The nature of dark matter, which constitutes 27% of the Universe's matter-energy content, remains one of the most challenging open questions in physics. Over the past two decades, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has reported an annual modulation in the detection rate of $\\approx$250 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors operated at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which the collaboration interprets as evidence of the galactic dark matter detection. However, this claim has not been independently confirmed and is refuted under certain dark matter particle and halo model scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to perform an experiment with the same target material. The ANAIS experiment uses 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory and it has been collecting data since August 2017 to model-independently test the DAMA/LIBRA result. This article presents the results of the annual modulation analysis corresponding to six years of ANAIS-112 data. Our results, the most sensitive to date with the same target material, NaI(Tl), are incompatible with the DAMA/LIBRA modulation signal at a 4$\\sigma$ confidence level. Such a discrepancy strongly challenges the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter interpretation and highlights the need to address systematic uncertainties affecting the comparison, particularly those related to the response of detectors to nuclear recoils, which may require further characterization of the DAMA crystals.",

    "abstract": "We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.",

    "title": "Use of solid fused silica etalon with broadband metallic coatings for   calibration of high-resolution optical spectrograph",
    "abstract": "Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\\'erot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\\'erot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.",

    "title": "Manufacturing Tolerances of Non-Planar Coils for an Optimized Tabletop   Stellarator",
    "abstract": "Stellarator coils are known for their complexity and departure from planarity, along with tight manufacturing tolerances in order to achieve the target magnetic field accuracy. These requirements can lead to increased costs and delays in assembly; failure to meet them can compromise the stellarator's performance. Small-scale experiments offer opportunities to develop and benchmark stellarator coil design and evaluation methods more quickly and at lower budget. In this work, we analyze precise 3D scans of the manufacturing deviations of two 3D-printed coil frames (steel, Ti alloy) and one CNC-machined coil frame (Al alloy), as part of assessing these approaches to fabricating high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils for a tabletop stellarator. The deviations are measured along the coil length, then modeled using Gaussian processes to extract characteristic length scales. Finally a statistical study of field accuracy is performed using relevant experimental parameters. We conclude that the manufacturing perturbations along the winding path from CNC-machining are almost an order of magnitude lower than those from Additive Manufacturing. Together with high overall fabrication accuracy, this allows for higher magnetic field precision and an improved assembly process.",

Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.",

    "title": "Impact of coherent wiggler radiation impedance in Tau-Charm factories",
    "abstract": "Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) has long been recognized as a significant source of longitudinal impedance driving microwave instability in electron storage rings. In the pursuit of higher luminosity, next-generation circular $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the few-GeV energy range, such as B-factories and Tau-Charm factories, are being designed with low-emittance beams and high beam currents. Damping wigglers are commonly introduced to reduce damping times and control beam emittance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of coherent wiggler radiation (CWR), a specific form of CSR generated within wigglers, on beam stability in Tau-Charm factories. We revisit the threshold conditions for CWR-induced microwave instability and evaluate its effects under realistic lattice configurations of collider rings. Furthermore, we examine theoretical models of longitudinal CWR impedance and identify improved formulations that better capture its influence. As an illustrative example, the developed CWR impedance models are applied to simulate beam stability in the Super Tau-Charm Facility currently under design in China.",

    "title": "Imaging simulation of a dual-panel PET geometry with ultrafast TOF   detectors",
    "abstract": "In positron emission tomography (PET), time-of-flight (TOF) information localizes source positions along lines of response. Cherenkov-radiator-integrated microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes have achieved 30 ps TOF resolution, demonstrating cross-sectional imaging without reconstruction. Such ultrafast TOF detectors would free PET from conventional ring geometries. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating imaging characteristics of a dual-panel PET with ultrafast TOF detectors using Geant4 simulation. Two detector panels ($137 \\times 137~\\text{mm}^2$), which consisted of 5.0 mm-thick bismuth germanate pixelized crystals with a 5.75 mm pitch, were placed face-to-face at a 300 mm distance. Imaging characteristics with various TOF resolutions from 30 to 90 ps were evaluated. Because degraded efficiency may cancel TOF gain in image quality, detection efficiency was also parameterized by reducing coincidence counts. Data acquisitions for a numerical multi-rod and uniform phantom (21 MBq) and a modified NEMA NU2 image quality phantom were simulated for 600 s. Results of the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction were compared with those of a backprojection (i.e., no reconstruction). The dual-panel PET required a 40 ps TOF resolution to have a similar spatial resolution to that of a non-TOF ring PET (300 mm in diameter) for the same detection efficiency. TOF showed benefit in the reconstruction of image quality phantom with 40% efficiency, and the image noise with 20% efficiency at 30 ps TOF was similar to the complete efficiency at 40 ps TOF. MLEM provided better imaging performance than backprojection, even at 30 ps TOF. The feasibility of the proposed dual-panel PET was shown.",

    "abstract": "Neutrinos, elusive and abundant, interact weakly with matter, making detection challenging. This thesis explores neutrino physics, focusing on mass hierarchy and oscillations, with emphasis on India's upcoming INO facility. The Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) within magnetized iron plates, aims to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely measure $\\theta_{23}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{32}$, potentially revealing new physics. The study advances RPC development through simulation techniques. A straight-line model calculates space charge effects during avalanche or streamer processes, improving electric field estimation speed and accuracy. Polarization effects in dielectric electrodes are analyzed, elucidating electric field dependence on electrode parameters. A new class, pAvalancheMC, integrated into Garfield++ software, combines straight-line and image charge models to simulate space charge effects. Using OpenMP for parallel computing, it achieves significant speed-ups in electron-ion pair generation and space charge field calculations. Practically, an eight-RPC stack was developed at VECC to measure cosmic muon scattering angles in high-density materials. A testbench evaluates efficiency, crosstalk, and hit uniformity. A reconstruction algorithm, validated with data from the IICHEP stack in Madurai, supports the VECC stack's potential.

    "title": "On operation and control of CW magnetrons for superconducting   accelerators",
    "abstract": "CW magnetrons, developed for industrial RF heaters, were suggested to feed RF cavities of superconducting accelerators due to higher efficiency and lower cost of RF power than provide traditionally used klystrons, IOTs or solid-state amplifiers. RF amplifiers driven by a master oscillator serve as coherent RF sources. CW magnetrons are regenerative RF auto generators with a huge regenerative gain. This causes regenerative instability with a notable noise when a magnetron operates as an auto generator i.e., with the anode voltage above the threshold of self-excitation. Traditionally, an injection locking by a small signal is used for phase stabilization of magnetrons. In this case CW magnetrons with the injection-locked (coherent) oscillations generate a notable level of noise. This may preclude use of CW magnetrons in this mode in the Superconducting RF (SRF) accelerators. This paper reviews PIC modeling and previously obtained experimental results for the operation and control of CW magnetrons, which led to the development of techniques most suitable for various SRF accelerators using forced RF oscillation of magnetrons, when the magnetron is launched by an injected forcing signal, and regenerative noise is suppressed.",

Building on our previous simulations, which established that these shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming Alfv\\'enic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated Alfv\\'en waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfv\\'en speed, is sufficiently small, $\\omega_c \\lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units). Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a resonance between the Alfv\\'en wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma, which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence of this type of shock identified previously.",

Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.",

    "abstract": "The dark photon is one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model and provides a minimal laboratory for quantum-mechanical phenomena. Light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) searches often adopt the dark photon-photon oscillation formula as if the sensitivity were independent of the light source, the wall, and the surrounding medium. In this paper, I revisit an LSW experiment whose light source is an undulator and systematically include various quantum effects: finite wave packets, kinematical suppression due to the microscopic structure of the source, and mixing suppression/enhancement in the wall and the air. We find that the resulting sensitivities deviate significantly from those obtained with the na\\\"{i}ve oscillation formula, especially depending on the mass of the dark photon, relevant to reflective index of the medium or walls, there can be resonance effects enhancing the sensitivity significantly. Accounting for these effects, we show that placing a photon detector outside the shielding along the beamline of a synchrotron facility enables an economical, parasitic LSW search for dark photons.",

    "title": "Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using   Liouville Mapping",
    "abstract": "Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\\parallel, v_\\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\\perp$ dependence on $\\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.",

    "title": "100s TeV/m-Level Particle Accelerators Driven by High-density Electron   Beams in Micro Structured Carbon Nanotube Forest Channel",
    "abstract": "Solid-state materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have the potential to support ultra-high accelerating fields in the TV/m range for charged particle acceleration. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using nanostructured CNTs forest to develop plasma-based accelerators at the 100 TeV/m-level, driven by high-density, ultra-relativistic electron beams, using fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two different acceleration mechanisms are proposed and investigated: the surface plasmon leakage field and the bubble wakefield. The leakage field, driven by a relatively low-density beam, can achieve an acceleration field up to TV/m, capable of accelerating both electron and positron beams. In particular, due to the direct acceleration by the driver beam, the positron acceleration is highly efficient with an average acceleration gradient of 2.3 TeV/m. In contrast, the bubble wakefield mechanism allows significantly higher acceleration fields, e.g. beyond 400 TV/m, with a much higher energy transfer efficiency of $66.7\\%$. In principle, electrons can be accelerated to PeV energies over distances of several meters. If the beam density is sufficiently high, the CNT target will be completely blown out, where no accelerating field is generated. Its threshold has been estimated. Two major challenges in these schemes are recognised and investigated. Leveraging the ultra-high energy and charge pumping rate of the driver beam, the nanostructured CNTs also offer significant potential for a wide range of advanced applications. This work represents a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy particle accelerators. We also outline conceptual experiments using currently available facilities, demonstrating that this approach is experimentally accessible.",

    "title": "Detuning Properties of RF Phase Modulation in an Electron Storage Ring",
    "abstract": "In electron storage rings, it is possible to increase the bunch length by applying phase modulation to the radio frequency accelerating field by choosing appropriate parameters for the modulation. Such a bunch lengthening effect improves beam parameters such as beam lifetime, which can help us achieve better beam stability. It is well known that the modulation frequency around the double synchrotron frequency is effective in lengthening the bunch. The dependence of bunch lengthening on modulation frequency, the so-called detuning property, has a peak around the double synchrotron frequency with a frequency width that depends on the modulation amplitude. Nonlinear effects due to phase modulation lead to a peak frequency shift in a negative direction from the double synchrotron frequency, accompanied by an asymmetric peak shape. Beam current also affects the properties of the detuning condition of such bunch lengthening. We investigated the detuning property using a theoretical model and systematic measurements at the electron storage ring KARA, and we verified the qualitative agreement between the experiments and the theoretical model. The macro-particle simulations have confirmed the agreement.",

    "abstract": "A method for direct phase difference reconstruction using single-shot dual-wavelength off-axis digital holography is presented. This approach enables direct imaging of samples with high steps without the need to reconstruct phase images at each individual wavelength. As the dual wavelengths in the reference and object arms pass through a common path in this configuration, single-wavelength arrangements can be applied. Due to the unique capability of the presented method, a sodium-vapor lamp source has been utilized to obtain two closely spaced wavelengths (${\\lambda}1 = 589 nm$ and ${\\lambda}2 = 589.6 nm$), with in a synthetic wavelength of ${\\Lambda} = 578.8 \\mu m$ in the Michelson configuration. To evaluate the validity of the method, the height of an air wedge measured using the proposed approach has been compared with the result obtained from phase unwrapping in the single-wavelength method. The capability of the proposed technique to image samples with high step structures is further demonstrated by measuring a $30 \\mu m$ step height and a glass plate with a thickness of approximately $140 \\mu m$.",

    "title": "First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating   crystal for low energy dark matter search",
    "abstract": "The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.",

Identifying where to position the magnets within a tokamak, specifically the poloidal field (PF) coils, is a design problem which requires balancing a number of competing economic, physical, and engineering objectives and constraints. In this paper, we show that multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO), an iterative optimisation technique utilising probabilistic machine learning models, can effectively explore this complex design space and return several optimal PF coil sets. These solutions span the Pareto front, a subset of the objective space that optimally satisfies the specified objective functions. We outline an easy-to-use BO framework and demonstrate that it outperforms alternative optimisation techniques while using significantly fewer computational resources. Our results show that BO is a promising technique for fusion design problems that rely on computationally demanding high-fidelity simulations.",

The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.",

    "abstract": "The TJ toroidal tearing mode code is used to make realistic predictions of the electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals generated by neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) in an ITER-like tokamak plasma equilibrium. In the so-called \"outer region'', which comprises the bulk of the plasma, helical harmonics of the magnetic field with the same toroidal mode number as the NTM, but different poloidal mode numbers, are coupled together by the Shafranov shifts and shaping of the equilibrium magnetic flux-surfaces. In the \"inner region'', which is localized in the vicinity of the NTM rational surface, helical harmonics whose poloidal and toroidal mode numbers are in the same ratio as those of the NTM are coupled together nonlinearly to produce a radially asymmetric magnetic island chain. The solutions in the inner and outer regions are asymptotically matched to one another. The asymptotic matching process determines the overall magnetic structure of the NTM, as well as the global perturbation to the electron temperature caused by the mode. A simulated ECE diagnostic is developed that accounts for the downshifting and broadening in frequency of the signal due to the relativistic mass increase of the emitting electrons.",

Using gyrokinetic simulations within the GENE--Tango framework, we identify suppressed inward thermodiffusion, caused by unfavorable magnetic geometry, as the primary cause. To overcome this limitation, we design a new configuration with a reduced mirror ratio, which enhances the contribution of passing electrons to the inward particle flux. This facilitates the formation of strongly peaked density profiles, suppresses turbulence, and leads to a substantial improvement in confinement. Our optimized configuration achieves nearly a twofold increase in energy confinement compared to Stellaris, highlighting the crucial role of optimizing particle transport in next-generation stellarator designs.",

    "title": "Enhanced beam transport via space charge mitigation in a multistage   accelerator for fusion plasma diagnostics",
    "abstract": "Efficient transport of high-current negative ion beams is critical for accurate plasma potential diagnostics using heavy-ion beam probe (HIBP) systems in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. However, strong space-charge effects often degrade transport efficiency, particularly for heavy ions such as Au-. In this study, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in beam transport by introducing an electrostatic lens effect through optimized voltage allocation in a multistage acceleration system. Numerical simulations using IGUN, supported by experiments with the LHD-HIBP system, show that this approach effectively suppresses space-charge-induced beam divergence and loss. Without requiring mechanical modifications to the beamline, the optimized configuration enables a 2-3 fold increase in Au-beam current injected into the tandem accelerator. Consequently, plasma potential measurements were extended to higher-density plasmas, reaching line-averaged electron densities up to $1.75\\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ with improved signal-to-noise ratio. This technique offers a compact, practical, and highly effective solution for transporting high-current heavy-ion beams under space-charge-dominated conditions. Beyond its impact on plasma diagnostics, the method is broadly applicable to a wide range of accelerator systems, including those used in scientific and industrial applications where high-intensity beam transport is required.",

    "abstract": "A new three-dimensional, non-linear Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model has been extended in MIPS code, incorporating parallel heat diffusivity. The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model used in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC) observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the developed model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for a typical super dense core discharge in LHD, with vacuum magnetic axis configuration RaxV = 3.85 m and magnetic axis beta \\beta0 = 4% plasma. This configuration corresponds to a plasma with a steep pressure gradient and strong Shafranov shift, which makes the plasma potentially unstable in the LHD. The model shows preliminary characteristics of the CDC event. The plasma is destabilized by high-n ballooning modes in the low-field side region during the linear regime, eventually leading to the collapse of the pressure and density profiles, together with the stochastization of the magnetic field and a shift to low-n modes centered at the core of the plasma after the non-linear coupling at the relaxation regime.",

Based on theoretical prediction there is a linear scaling of the ReBCO cable hysteresis loss with the crossing magnetic field possibly generating power loss independent of the magnetic field ramping speed. This feature makes this ReBCO cable suitable for the construction of rapid-cycling magnets. In this work we outline the design of a dipole magnet for 1.7 T gap magnetic field and discuss the helium coolant parameters for the minimal electric power.",

    "title": "Plasma pressure response to non-inductive current drive in axisymmetric   visco-resistive MHD steady-states",
    "abstract": "We investigate self-consistent, steady-state axisymmetric solutions of incompressible tokamak plasma using a visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic model. A key contribution of this work is the formulation of Poisson's equation that governs the pressure profile. Our analysis reveals that the current modeling fails to produce realistic pressure levels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce additional non-inductive current drives, akin to those generated by neutral beam injection or radio frequency heating, modeled as modifications to the toroidal current. Numerical simulations validate our enhanced model, showing significant improvements in pressure profile characteristics. In the cases examined, the effect of these current drives on the velocity profiles is moderate, except when the non-inductive current drives induce reversals in the total toroidal current density, leading to non-nested flux surfaces with internal separatrices.",

    "title": "Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX   detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN",
    "abstract": "The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the 157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched 157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 % increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %) and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.",

    "title": "Two-dimensional spatially resolved measurements of helium metastable   densities by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy in atmospheric   pressure RF plasma jets",
    "abstract": "Helium metastable species play a critical role in sustaining radio-frequency (RF) driven micro atmospheric pressure plasma jets through Penning ionization and for the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Their densities are typically measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). Most spatially resolved TDLAS approaches rely on mechanical scanning of a narrow laser beam across the plasma, which is time-consuming and limits spatial resolution. In this work, we present an advanced two-dimensional (2D) TDLAS method that enables direct spatial mapping of helium metastable densities without the need for mechanical scanning. A rotating optical diffuser is employed to suppress speckle interference and generate uniform illumination across the plasma region. The absorption profile is captured using a short-wavelength infrared camera equipped with a telecentric lens, achieving high spatial resolution (approximately 10 {\\mu}m) across the entire field of view. This approach significantly enhances both data quality and acquisition speed. The improved 2D TDLAS system is applied to measure helium metastable densities in plasma jets with structured electrodes driven by different tailored voltage waveforms. The results show very good qualitative agreement with fluid simulations and previously reported experimental data.",
