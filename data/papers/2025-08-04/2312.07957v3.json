  "title": "Scintillation characteristics of an undoped CsI crystal at   low-temperature for dark matter search",
  "abstract": "The scintillation characteristics of 1 g undoped CsI crystal were studied by directly coupling two silicon photomultipliers(SiPMs) over a temperature range from room temperature to 86 K. The scintillation decay time and light output were measured using x-ray and gamma-ray peaks from a 109Cd radioactive source. An increase in decay time was observed as the temperature decreased from room temperature to 86 K, ranging from 76 ns to 605 ns. The light output also increased, reaching 26.2 +/- 1.3 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent at 86 K. Leveraging the significantly enhanced scintillation light output of the undoped CsI crystal at low temperatures, coupling it with SiPMs results in a promising detector for rare event searches. Both cesium and iodine have an odd number of protons, making them suitable targets for probing dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of the proposed detector to such interactions, incorporating the Migdal effect and assuming 200 kg of undoped CsI crystals for dark matter searches. The results indicate that undoped CsI coupled with SiPM can achieve world-competitive sensitivity for low-mass dark matter detection, particularly in the context of dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions.",
