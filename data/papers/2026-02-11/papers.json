    "title": "Performance Optimization and Characterization of 7-pad Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detectors",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10MΩ resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.",

    "title": "Conceptual Design of a Novel Highly Granular Crystal Electromagnetic Calorimeter for Future Higgs Factories",
    "abstract": "Next-generation high-energy electron-positron colliders, operating as Higgs factories, require an unprecedented jet energy resolution for precision measurements of Higgs and Z/W bosons. To address this challenge, a conceptual design is presented for a novel high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter that combines the superior intrinsic energy resolution of a homogeneous calorimeter with the fine segmentation required for particle-flow reconstruction. The crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design is based on orthogonally arranged long scintillating crystal bars read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at both ends. Key design specifications were established through comprehensive simulation studies. Critical technical considerations, including crystal choices, photosensors, electronics, mechanical support, and radiation damage, are discussed. A dedicated digitisation framework was developed to realistically model effects from the crystal, SiPMs, and readout electronics. The performance of a single calorimeter module was evaluated using simulated electron showers. Simulation results for a single module demonstrate an excellent electromagnetic energy resolution of $1.12\\%/\\sqrt{E(\\mathrm{GeV})}\\oplus0.24\\%$ and an energy linearity within $\\pm0.5\\%$ for electrons from 3 GeV to 100 GeV. The performance significantly exceeds the design requirement of $\\leq 3\\%/\\sqrt{E(\\mathrm{GeV})}\\oplus1\\%$. The results establish the feasibility of the proposed high-granularity crystal calorimeter concept and point to a promising pathway toward the precision calorimetry required for future high-energy electron-positron collider experiments.",

    "title": "Scaling laws for the cutoff wavenumber of the short-wavelength ion-temperature-gradient mode in a Z-pinch",
    "abstract": "We use a heuristic fluid model to predict the dependence of the cutoff wave number for the short-wavelength ion temperature gradient (SWITG) mode on ion density gradient, ion temperature gradient (ITG) and ion-electron temperature ratio. In particular, we predict that the cutoff wave number increases linearly with increasing ITG for sufficiently large values of the ITG. Direct numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic dispersion relation using a purpose-built solver confirm the predicted scalings at large ITG values and find a weaker power-law scaling for intermediate ITG values. Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence. Applying the critical balance conjecture additionally provides scalings for the aspect ratio of the SWITG turbulent eddies.",

    "title": "A 4D-STEM Tomographic Framework Assisted by Object Tracking for Nanoparticle Structure Solution",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has emerged as a powerful method for solving the structures of sub-micron-sized particles down to nanoparticles. However, it faces technical challenges when applied to beam-sensitive samples or conglomerated and agglomerated nanoparticles. This study presents a novel approach that combines 4D-STEM tomography with object tracking and segmentation algorithms to overcome these limitations and achieve single-crystalline 3D ED datasets from nanopowder samples. The method and data quality are assessed on brookite TiO2 nanorods and beam-sensitive CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. To finely sample the reciprocal-space, the data acquisition was automated to acquire hundreds of 4D-STEM scans using a slightly convergent beam and at fine tilt steps. The proposed method provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, low illumination time for reducing beam damage, and the ability to analyze multiple particles from a single tomographic dataset. The procedure is optimized to be feasible using commercially available desktops and detectors. This extends the method applicability in the community to the systems and samples that were previously inaccessible for conventional 3D ED methods, particularly breaking the technical challenges for the data acquisition.",

    "title": "Structure-preserving long-time simulations of turbulence in magnetized ideal fluids",
    "abstract": "We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie--Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.",

    "title": "X-ray reflection: a FLUKA model and its application in the design of synchrotron light beamlines and CERN's Future Circular Collider",
    "abstract": "Relying on atomic scattering factors from evaluated databases, a new model for the reflectivity of x rays on solid surfaces has been developed for FLUKA v4-6.0. This model accounts for the variation of reflectivity as a function of the photon energy, its incidence angle, and linear polarisation; surface roughness effects are also taken into account. FLUKA reflectivities agree well with those obtained from state-of-the-art codes used for the characterization of optical devices, both for homogeneous solids and for multilayer mirrors. This new capability renders FLUKA a nearly one-stop shop for synchrotron radiation simulations: emission from bending magnets and wigglers, photon transport and interaction, electromagnetic (and hadronic when applicable) shower development in complex geometries, as well as x-ray reflection at designated solid surfaces can now be all accounted for in a single FLUKA run. This streamlined FLUKA simulation workflow greatly simplifies the plethora of simulation tools that Monte Carlo practitioners previously needed to rely on. Two application scenarios of this new reflectivity model are showcased: first, the use of a multilayer mirror to deflect x rays from an optical hutch onto an experimental hall at the MINERVA beamline of the ALBA synchrotron and, second, the assessment of the photon flux near the interaction point at the CERN's Future Circular Collider (in its electron-positron stage) as a result of upstream x-ray reflections.",

    "title": "Binary Classification of Light and Dark Time Traces of a Transition Edge Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.",

    "abstract": "An enhancement of core impurity transport is observed in high-density plasmas of the stellarator LHD heated by neutral beam injection when continuous lithium (Li) granule dropping is performed. In the experiments reported here, in which the TESPEL is employed to inject trace amounts of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) into the plasma core, confinement times for these impurities are seen to reduce significantly when Li dropping is applied, this reduction being more notable for Mo. In order to gain some initial insight into these observations, simulations are performed using the drift-kinetic transport code SFINCS for the Mo case. These simulations indicate that, while neoclassical transport prevails for the main plasma components (electrons, majority ions and low Z impurities), the classical contribution seems to be dominant for transporting Mo impurities. In summary, this work reports the first experimental observation of the degradation of mid-Z and high-Z impurity confinement induced by the continuous dropping of Li granules into a high-density stellarator plasma. In the case of the Mo impurity, simulations suggest that classical transport is the key mechanism underlying the enhanced impurity transport.",

    "abstract": "Space-charge-limited (SCL) current density for time-invariant injection (under long-pulse condition) via the diode cathode is the maximum transportable density, while it can be leveraged higher when the injection pulselength becomes shorter than the transmit time for electrons (i.e., under short-pulse condition). However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition.",

    "abstract": "Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.",

    "abstract": "We establish both local and global bifurcation results for traveling periodic solutions of the one-dimensional two-species Vlasov-Poisson equation. These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well.",

    "title": "Development of a Reduced Multi-Fluid Equilibrium Model and Its Application to Proton-Boron Spherical Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "Proton-Boron fusion requires extreme ion temperatures and robust confinement, making Spherical Tokamaks (ST) with high-power neutral beam injection primary candidates. In these devices, strong toroidal rotation and the large mass disparity between protons and boron ions drive complex multi-fluid effects - specifically centrifugal species separation and electrostatic polarization - that standard single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models fail to capture. While comprehensive multi-fluid models are often numerically stiff, we develop a reduced model balancing physical fidelity with computational robustness. By retaining dominant toroidal rotation and self-consistent potential while neglecting poloidal inertia and pressure anisotropy, the model couples a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation with species-specific Bernoulli relations and a quasi-neutrality constraint. The model is applied to two representative p-B ST configurations: the experimental EHL-2 and reactor-scale EHL-3B. Simulation results demonstrate that equilibrium modifications are governed by the ion Mach number ($M$). In the low-rotation regime ($M < 0.5$), multi-fluid effects are weak and solutions approach the single-fluid limit. However, at $M > 2$, strong centrifugal forces drive significant boron accumulation at the low-field side (LFS) and generate an internal electrostatic potential on the order of 10 kV. These findings confirm the necessity of multi-fluid modeling for accurate p-$^{11}$B reactor design and establish a theoretical foundation for future investigations into stability, transport, and free-boundary dynamics.",

    "title": "Synchrotron-based Photonuclear Neutron Source for Energy, Medicine and Radiation Testing",
    "abstract": "The global availability of high-intensity neutron sources is restricted by the prohibitive costs of spallation facilities and the decommissioning of aging research reactors, while compact accelerator-driven sources (CANS) are fundamentally limited by target power density and thermal-mechanical stress. Here, we introduce SYNERGY (SYnchrotron-driven NEutron source for Research, energy Generation and therapY), a paradigm-shifting architecture that overcomes these bottlenecks by decoupling charged-particle acceleration from neutron production. By utilizing a storage ring to drive external photoneutron targets via synchrotron radiation, this topological separation ensures targets interact exclusively with a continuous-wave (CW) photon beam, minimizing thermo-mechanical shocks and enabling beam powers exceeding 200 kW per beamline. Through a systematic parametric analysis cross-validated using OpenMC, MCNPX, and FLUKA, we demonstrate single-beamline neutron production rates from $2.8\\times10^{14}$ n/s to $1.3\\times10^{15}$ n/s. With an inherent multi-beamline capacity feeding up to 50 independent stations, the total facility intensity exceeds $6.0\\times10^{16}$ n/s. By bridging the gap between laboratory and national-scale infrastructure, SYNERGY provides a high-intensity, multi-user platform for subcritical systems, medical isotope production, and boron neutron capture therapy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the optical effects that occur near a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) with a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter (DM) halo are explored. We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.",

Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $β= 2μ_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$β$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.",

    "title": "Weak and reversed magnetic shear effects on internal kink and fishbone modes",
    "abstract": "Advanced tokamak scenarios often feature weak or reversed magnetic shear configurations. In this study, the hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code is used to investigate the effects of reversed magnetic shear on internal kink and fishbone mode in a circular shaped limiter tokamak. In the absence of energetic particles (EPs), the mode growth rate initially increases and then decreases as the magnetic shear changes from positive to negative, indicating stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear on the internal kink mode. In the presence of EPs, when the reversed magnetic shear region is sufficiently narrow, the transition from internal kink/fishbone modes to double kink/fishbone modes takes place, and the stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear can significantly dominate the destabilization of EPs. For non-resonant modes, the EP beta fraction $β_f$ for excitation increases with $q_{min}$, concurrent with progressively lower growth rates in non-resonant fishbone modes. When the equilibrium profile has an internal transport barrier (ITB), broader ITB widths suppress internal kink modes more effectively, whereas steeper temperature gradients strengthen EP stabilization.",

    "title": "Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure",
    "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).",

    "title": "Preprint: Sheath thickness measurements with the biased plasma impedance probe, Agreement with Child Langmuir scaling",
    "abstract": "Plasma sheaths play a central role in plasma-surface interactions, yet their thickness remains challenging to measure experimentally. Although classical analytical models such as the Child-Langmuir (CL) sheath model provide clear predictions for sheath thickness, experimental validation has been limited because most diagnostics either rely on indirect, multi-step inference (e.g., Langmuir probes) or require invasive and technically demanding techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that the plasma impedance probe (PIP), when operated with a controlled DC bias, enables relatively direct, model-informed measurements of sheath thickness that are reasonably straightforward to implement experimentally. Across a range of discharge conditions, biased-PIP sheath thickness measurements are found to follow CL scaling closely, requiring a single, consistent empirical correction factor of $α\\approx 0.74$ to reconcile the measured thickness with CL predictions. Concurrent measurements of plasma density and electron damping show that probe biasing does not significantly perturb the bulk plasma density, supporting the validity of the biased-PIP approach. Building on this validation, we leverage the empirically determined $α$ factor to extend the floating (unbiased) PIP analysis to obtain model-dependent estimates of electron temperature and plasma potential without electrical biasing. A side-by-side comparison demonstrates close agreement between floating-PIP results and those obtained from a biased Langmuir probe. Taken together, these results establish the PIP as a complementary diagnostic to the Langmuir probe, expanding the range of accessible plasma measurements while providing experimental support for classical sheath models.",

The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \\approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.",

    "title": "Modelling Conduction Cooling of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets using a Thermal Thin Shell Approximation",
    "abstract": "Understanding the thermal behaviour of superconducting accelerator magnets is essential to ensure stable and reliable operation. This work presents an extension of the Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) Multipole module to include collar and pole regions of accelerator magnets, which influences the overall thermal response. A thermal thin shell approximation (TSA), which is shown to be effective in previous works, is employed to model thermal insulation layers efficiently, replacing an insulation surface mesh. The main novelty of this work lies in the development of a method to model the thermal connection between the magnet winding and the collar and pole regions via the TSA.   To assess the accuracy and computational efficiency of the novel method, temperature and field variations are computed for a current ramp-up scenario. The thermal solution is coupled to a fully resolved magnetodynamic solution to capture the interaction between thermal and electromagnetic behaviour. The results obtained with the TSA are then compared to classical finite element (FE) solutions with explicitly meshed insulation domains. The TSA predicts the maximum temperature within 2-4% of the reference solution while substantially reducing mesh complexity and achieving up to a 5 times speed-up in computation time. While the TSA has traditionally been employed for short-duration quench simulations with high heat fluxes between magnet turns, these results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for current ramp scenarios with low heat fluxes, significantly expanding its application range beyond what has been previously reported in the literature.   To illustrate potential applications of this new functionality, conduction cooling through the collar region is studied, comparing different cooling configurations and collar materials.",

    "title": "JOREK simulations of the X-point radiator formation and its movement in ASDEX Upgrade",
    "abstract": "Future large-scale magnetic confinement fusion reactors require operational regimes that can avoid extreme heat fluxes onto the plasma-facing components. One promising regime is the X-point radiator (XPR), which relies on a highly radiative, cold and dense plasma volume forming above the X-point, and which can be accessed via impurity seeding. Experimentally, the height of the XPR can be controlled by adjusting the seeding rate and heating power. This contribution presents axisymmetric (2D) simulations of the XPR regime in ASDEX Upgrade using the nonlinear MHD code JOREK extended with a kinetic particle framework for the main species neutrals and nitrogen impurities. With the time-dependent simulations, the progression from attached divertors to a complete detachment with the XPR formation is shown, highlighting the effects of the neutrals and impurities separately. Amidst this progression, the formation and the loss of the high-field-side high-density are observed. After the XPR is well-formed at the height of 6.8 cm, the fuelling and seeding rates are adjusted so that the XPR remains stationary. From the stationary case, the seeding rate is then changed to see how the XPR location reacts. By increasing and decreasing the seeding rate, the XPR responds by moving upwards and downwards, respectively. These simulations show JOREK's capability of simulating time-varying XPR, which will provide a baseline for the transition to 3D simulations, so the MHD activities and their interaction with the XPR can be studied.",

    "abstract": "The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the \"MOPS-Hub Mock-up\"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based \"MOPS-Hub\" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.",

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of the horizontal vertex $(x,y)$ from the S2 electroluminescence pattern is essential for fiducialization and background rejection in dual-phase argon time projection chambers. In this work, we perform a Geant4-based simulation study using the G4DS framework to investigate how detector geometry, in particular the distance between the top photodetector plane and the gas pocket, impacts S2-based XY reconstruction. A compact dual-phase argon TPC instrumented with seven Hamamatsu R8520-506 PMTs is simulated with electron recoils at 41.5 keV (corresponding to the ${}^{83m}\\mathrm{Kr}$ calibration energy), as well as 1.0 keV to probe the low-S2 regime. The PMT array height is scanned from 0 mm to 50 mm, and XY positions are reconstructed using a geometrical solid-angle (GSA) method with the S2 emission modeled by 1 mm-thick slices across the 7 mm gas pocket. The results show a clear non-monotonic dependence of reconstruction bias and resolution on PMT height, driven by the trade-off between S2 light sharing and photon statistics. These findings provide guidance for geometry optimization in future low-threshold dual-phase argon detectors and will be validated with upcoming prototype measurements.",

Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.",

    "title": "Effects of Turbulent Energy Exchange between Electrons and Ions on Global Temperature Profiles",
    "abstract": "Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions.",

    "title": "Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $λ_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $λ_s$, characterized by the parameters $\\frac{λ_s}{λ_D}$ and $\\frac{L}{λ_s}$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. Self-similar solutions with spatially uniform electron temperature with exponential time dependence are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface as the target interacts with the rising laser intensity envelope. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.",

    "title": "Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo",
    "abstract": "The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures, and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with both analytical models and polarisation observations.",

    "title": "A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization",
    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most current stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: stage-1 for the equilibrium and stage-2 for a coil design that reproduces its magnetic configuration. Because few proxies connect both stages, two-stage optimization can produce plasmas that have high-quality physical properties but overly complex coils. In recent years, single-stage optimization is increasingly used to optimize the plasma and coils simultaneously, in order to improve the plasma-coil balance. However, all existing single-stage tools are specialized for filament coils, cannot model coil systems containing permanent magnets (PM) or dipole arrays, and remain challenged by numerical problems.The quasi-single-stage (QSS) optimization finds a middle-ground by integrating a coil optimization subproblem into stage-1 optimization. We present a flexible, differentiable coil complexity proxy based on the newly developed QUADCOIL coil optimization code. QUADCOIL is fast and can target realistic coil metrics and constraints that are unavailable to codes with comparable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the QUADCOIL proxy by presenting two QSS optimization studies. The first study produces a permanent magnet solution for the MUSE stellarator with 29% fewer magnets than previous solutions. The second study produces a coil solution for the ARIES-CS stellarator with approx 30% reductions in both peak and average coil force.",

    "title": "Dipole Localization Using An Integrated Radio Frequency Atomic Magnetometer",
    "abstract": "Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.",

    "abstract": "The properties of radiation from a three-frequency helical undulator are thoroughly investigated. It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions.",

It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum (TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "We present a microscopic calculation of spontaneous photon emission by twisted (paraxial) electrons propagating through inhomogeneous, axisymmetric magnetic fields. We construct exact electron states that incorporate transverse mode structure and wavefront curvature by combining the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation with a geometric framework based on Lewis-Ermakov invariants and metaplectic transformations. We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally. This mechanism generalizes Landau-level radiation to nonasymptotic, structured electron states and establishes a direct connection between noncyclic geometric evolution and photon emission.",

    "title": "On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer",
    "abstract": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

    "abstract": "Open research information (ORI) play a central role in shaping how scientific knowledge is produced, disseminated, validated, and reused across the research lifecycle. While the visibility of such ORI infrastructures is often assessed through citation-based metrics, in this study, we present a full-text, natural language processing (NLP) driven scientometric framework to systematically quantify the impact of ORI infrastructures beyond citation counts, using the LXCat platform for low temperature plasma (LTP) research as a representative case study. The modeling of LTPs and interpretation of LTP experiments rely heavily on accurate data, much of which is hosted on LXCat, a community-driven, open-access platform central to the LTP research ecosystem. To investigate the scholarly impact of the LXCat platform over the past decade, we analyzed a curated corpus of full-text research articles citing three foundational LXCat publications. We present a comprehensive pipeline that integrates chemical entity recognition, dataset and solver mention extraction, affiliation based geographic mapping and topic modeling to extract fine-grained patterns of data usage that reflect implicit research priorities, data practices, differential reliance on specific databases, evolving modes of data reuse and coupling within scientific workflows, and thematic evolution. Importantly, our proposed methodology is domain-agnostic and transferable to other ORI contexts, and highlights the utility of NLP in quantifying the role of scientific data infrastructures and offers a data-driven reflection on how open-access platforms like LXCat contribute to shaping research directions. This work presents a scalable scientometric framework that has the potential to support evidence based evaluation of ORI platforms and to inform infrastructure design, governance, sustainability, and policy for future development.",

    "title": "Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers",
    "abstract": "Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.",

    "title": "Charge transport and mode transition in dual-energy electron beam diodes",
    "abstract": "This Letter uncovers five distinct charge transport modes and their transitions in dual-energy electron beam diodes. We via first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations establish that the specific mode (e.g., space charge oscillations) and the current transport characteristics are essentially governed by the interplay between the electron beam energy and injected current density. A generalized analysis is conducted for n-component electron beams, and a theoretical piecewise function is for the transmitted current density proposed, which agrees well with the PIC results under designed conditions. The discovery provides a mechanistic picture of multiple electron beam transport in diodes, paving the way for novel designs of high-performance modern vacuum electronic devices.",

    "title": "Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector",
    "abstract": "Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $γ$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\\&M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a \"missing gamma\" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear ballooning instabilities in non-axisymmetric equilibria exhibit spatial localization along field lines that mirrors Anderson localization in disordered lattices. We demonstrate that this localization fundamentally alters nonlinear stability, transforming a global ballooning crash into a connectivity phase transition on a Ginzburg-Landau network. We identify a dimensionless number, denoted by ηc, as a topological threshold derived from continuum percolation theory. Below this threshold, global instability is topologically arrested as isolated scintillations, providing a rigorous explanation for the robust, benign saturation observed in experiments. Above this threshold, a spanning cluster path forms, unlocking rapid and potentially disruptive nonlinear growth.",

    "title": "Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout",
    "abstract": "We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.",

    "title": "Information Theory: An X-ray Microscopy Perspective",
    "abstract": "X-ray microscopy (XRM) is commonly used to obtain three-dimensional information on internal microstructure, but the imaging pipeline introduces noise, redundancy and information loss at multiple stages. This paper treats the XRM workflow as an information-processing system acting on a finite information budget. Using entropy, mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence, we quantify how acquisition, denoising, alignment, sparse-angle sampling, dose variation and reconstruction reshape the statistical structure of projection data and reconstructed volumes. Case studies based on the Walnut 1 dataset illustrate how these processes redistribute information and impose bottlenecks. We summarise the workflow using a unified information budget and show that mutual information provides a reconstruction-agnostic indicator of fidelity, supporting quantitative comparison and optimisation of XRM protocols, particularly under low-dose or time-constrained conditions",

    "title": "Collision of two radial rarefaction waves in unmagnetized ambient plasma: effects of the ambient plasma density",
    "abstract": "The expansion of two circular rarefaction waves in vacuum or in a thin ambient plasma is examined with particle-in-cell simulations that resolve two spatial dimensions. In the simulation with no ambient plasma, the rarefaction waves interpenetrate near the symmetry line between both rarefaction wave centers. The exponential density decrease of rarefaction waves with distance implies that the sum of their density does not lead to a density maximum near the symmetry line. The absence of a density maximum, which would yield a repelling electric potential for the inflowing rarefaction wave ions near the symmetry line, and the high interpenetration speed of the ion beams lead to ion-ion instabilities rather than shocks in the overlap layer. The simulations with ambient plasma show that the rarefaction waves pile up the ions of the ambient plasma near the symmetry line. A localized piston of hot ambient ions forms. If its density is large enough, its thermoelectric field allows reverse shocks to grow in the rarefaction waves. These reverse shocks move slowly in the simulation frame and enclose a slab of downstream plasma. A decrease in the speed of the rarefaction wave ions upstream of the shocks with time leads to their collapse.",

    "title": "Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks",
    "abstract": "We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel (filamentation) instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(σ\\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(σ\\lesssim10^{-4})$. Shocks with precursors shaped by Bell modes efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}\\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\\max}\\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}\\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell regime. On the other hand, when the precursor is dominated by Weibel modes, the shock efficiently generates both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{i}}\\sim\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}\\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\\mathrm{max}}\\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.",

    "title": "A nonlinear multiphysics model for the design validation of the ASTAROTH copper-steel cryogenic chamber",
    "abstract": "Among the global efforts to directly detect dark matter, the only positive claim so far relies on NaI(Tl) crystal detectors, making this technology of particular interest. ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation.",

    "title": "Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo",
    "abstract": "For more than 40 years the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major focus of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale non-linear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo at large magnetic Reynolds numbers, $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm>1$ and $Pm<1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical set-ups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in non-asymptotic turbulent magnetohydrodynamic regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach the ultimate regime in such 'realistic' global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.",
