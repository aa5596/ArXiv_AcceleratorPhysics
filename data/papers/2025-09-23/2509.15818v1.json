  "title": "Scalable CVD Graphene Field-Effect Transistor Platform for Viral   Detection: Application to COVID-19",
  "abstract": "The rapid and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscored the urgent need for fast, reliable, and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of responding to current and future viral threats. Early diagnosis is key to limiting transmission, and biosensors based on nanomaterials offer promising solutions for accurate and rapid bioanalyte detection. In this work, we present a scalable matrix of graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the direct and rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. High-quality graphene is functionalized in a single step with ACE2-His, enabling detection of the spike protein with a limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A robust statistical analysis, based on measurements from approximately 70 devices per analyte concentration, demonstrates the reproducibility and reliability of the platform. This label-free, scalable, and reproducible COVID-19 antigen sensor can be readily adapted to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other viral pathogens, offering a flexible approach for future diagnostic applications.",
