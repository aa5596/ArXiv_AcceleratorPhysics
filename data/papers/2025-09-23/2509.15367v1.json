  "title": "Fabrication of the HFVMTF Double-Bath Cryostat",
  "abstract": "The High Field Vertical Magnet Test Facility (HFVMTF) at Fermilab is designed to test superconducting magnets up to 20 tons and 1.3 meters in diameter. Central to the facility is a double-bath superfluid helium cryostat reaching 1.8 K at 1.2 bar. Integrated with a 15 T superconducting dipole from LBNL, HFVMTF supports HTS cable testing for fusion applications. This paper presents the design and fabrication of the cryostat, with a focus on two complex components: the 2 K heat exchanger and the lambda plate. The heat exchanger thermally links sub-atmospheric and pressurized helium baths. The 1.4-meter lambda plate provides thermal isolation and structural support for over 20 tons under 1.3 bar pressure differential. Finite Element Analysis validated the vessel's integrity under maximum load conditions.",
