  "title": "Development of BPM electronics for PIP-II at Fermilab",
  "abstract": "This paper presents the uTCA4.0-based BPM electronics for PIP-II, featuring four 250 MSPS ADCs and a Xilinx UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA with 10 GbE uplink. Design elements include signal conditioning, clock, and thermal management. The FPGA performs signal processing, time tagging, digital down-conversion, and phase drift compensation. Position and phase resolution, and thermal stability - is validated through dedicated testing.",
