  "title": "Time-of-flight Energy Measurements with BPMs",
  "abstract": "The energy of a bunched non-relativistic ion beam can be deduced from measuring the beam phases in neighbouring Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). This report discusses implementation of such a procedure at the PIP-II H- linac being constructed at Fermilab. The case when the flight time between BPMs is longer than the period of BPM frequency is considered in more detail. When absolute BPM phase calibration is not available, the BPM phase information can be used to track deviations of the beam energy from the de-sired value. Such \"energy deviation\" parameter is operationally implemented at the transfer line between 400 MeV Linac and the Booster, and its analog is expected to be used in the transfer line from PIP-II as well.",
