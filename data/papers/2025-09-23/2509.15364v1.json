  "title": "Advancing 1D thermo-hydraulic tools for large cryogenic facilities",
  "abstract": "The Cryogenic Division at Fermilab develops large-scale cryogenic systems for particle accelerators and superconducting magnet test facilities. To support design and diagnostics, a Python-based code was created to calculate pressure drops in components such as valves and pipes. This paper presents recent enhancements to the code, including new heat transfer functions that improve the accuracy of thermal and hydraulic predictions. The first application models pressure and temperature changes in Proton Improvement Plant PIP-II relief pipes, aiding pipe sizing and protecting relief valves. The second example analyses heat load evolution in a pipe carrying sub-atmospheric helium, helping interpret temperature sensor data and understand gas return behavior to cold compressors. These improvements significantly expand the tool's capabilities, offering a practical resource for designing and troubleshooting cryogenic systems under dynamic thermal and flow conditions.",
