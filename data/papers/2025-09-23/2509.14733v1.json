  "title": "Effect of construction steels on PMTs detection efficiency at JUNO",
  "abstract": "We study the impact of the carbon steel rebars and the steel TT bridge within the JUNO structure on the shielding effect of the coils. Our simulations demonstrate that despite the presence of carbon steel structures of the rebars of the water pool and the TT bridge within the central detector vicinity, the residual magnetic field experienced by the PMTs remains within the acceptable limit established by the JUNO experiment of 10% for CD-PMTs and 20% for Veto-PMTs, compared to the geomagnetic field. The maximum magnetic fields experienced by the CD-PMTs and Veto-PMTs are 9% and 18% of the geomagnetic field strength, respectively. These findings indicate that the residual magnetic field has minimal impacts on the PMTs detection efficiency.",
