  "title": "Measuring Orbit Responses with Oscillating Trajectories in the Fermilab   Linac",
  "abstract": "Recording changes in beam transverse positions re-ported by Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) in response to a beam deflection by an upstream dipole corrector (orbit response) is a powerful tool for analysis of accelerator optics and assisting with machine tuning. In the Fermilab Linac, orbit responses are recorded by oscillating the currents of up to 19 correctors, providing faster, drift-resistant measurements through frequency-domain analysis. This report describes the technique, including error estimations and consistency checks and shows an example of the measurements.",
