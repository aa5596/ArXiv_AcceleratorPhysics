  "title": "Broadband Single-Shot THz Sampling Using Reflection Gratings",
  "abstract": "Single-shot electro-optic sampling (EOS) is a powerful method enabling the measurement of weak terahertz signals that would otherwise require prohibitively long acquisition times. This is generally achieved by encoding the EOS time delay into a spatial, angular, or frequency coordinate. In general, this technique operates well up to 3 THz but becomes more challenging for larger bandwidths, due to dispersion and imaging imperfections. Here, we demonstrate a reliable angular-encoding single shot EOS implementation that reaches frequencies beyond 6 THz. Diffraction simulations are used to design the experimental setup and adapt this technique to commercial reflection gratings, removing the need for custom-built echelon mirrors. Furthermore, we show that, contrary to earlier reports, group delay dispersion from angular dispersion does not reduce the bandwidth of single-shot EOS.",
