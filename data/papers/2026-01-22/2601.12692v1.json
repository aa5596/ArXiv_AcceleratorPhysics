  "title": "Dimensional Analysis Approach to Experiments in Z pinch Devices",
  "abstract": "The physical behavior of discharges in Z pinch devices can be completely deciphered in terms of only three dimensionless parameters. These parameters can be arranged in a way that draw a surface in 3D space. This surface compiles all the accessible information on the macroscopic physical behavior of each possible Z pinch discharge. We analyze the practical problems the drawing of this surface encounters and in view of the situation, we devote the remainder of the article to outline a feasible method for estimating the plasma temperature in Z pinch discharges.",
