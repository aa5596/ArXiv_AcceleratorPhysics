    "title": "XFEL Imaging Techniques for High Energy Density and Inertial Fusion Energy Research at HED-HiBEF",
    "abstract": "The imaging platform developed at the High Energy Density - Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields (HED-HiBEF) instrument at the European XFEL and its applications to high energy density and fusion related research are presented. The platform combines the XFEL beam with the high-intensity short-pulse laser ReLaX and the high-energy nanosecond-pulse laser DiPOLE-100X. The spatial resolution is better than 500 nm and the temporal resolution of the order of 50 fs. We show examples of blast waves and converging cylindrical shocks in aluminium, resonant absorption measurements of specific charged states in copper with ReLaX and planar shocks in polystyrene material generated by DiPOLE-100X. We also discuss the possibilities introduced by combining this imaging platform with a kJ-class laser.",

    "abstract": "Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.",

    "title": "The Geometry of Flux Surfaces with Quasi-Poloidal Symmetry",
    "abstract": "Quasi-poloidal (QP) magnetic fields have desirable properties for confining plasma: no radial drift of guiding centres (with positive implications for neoclassical transport), zero Pfirsch-Schlüter current, a lower level of damping for poloidal flows, leading to reduced anomalous transport, and possible stability benefits. Despite their attractive properties, QP fields are not amenable to the near-axis expansion, a major theoretical tool for understanding toroidal fields. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for defining and understanding QP flux surfaces. This framework relies on a simplification that transforms the task of finding a quasi-poloidal flux surface from a 3D problem to a 2D problem. This simplification also applies to asymmetric magnetic mirrors with desirable properties. We sketch how this 2D problem can form the basis of an efficient optimisation problem for finding QP flux surfaces. We leverage this 2D problem for theoretical understanding: for instance, we identify one class of QP flux surfaces that are naturally flat mirrors (Velasco et al. 2023). The reduced model is validated against numerically optimised QP equilibria. We further utilise the reduced model to explain the prevalence of cusps, high mirror ratios, and narrow pinch points in these numerical equilibria.",

    "abstract": "In anticipation of the completion of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) programme by the end of 2041, CERN is preparing to launch a new major facility in the mid-2040s. According to the 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), the highest-priority next collider is an electron-positron Higgs factory, followed in the longer term by a hadron-hadron collider at the highest achievable energy. The CERN directorate established a Future Colliders Comparative Evaluation working group in June 2023. This group brings together project leaders and domain experts to conduct a consistent evaluation of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and alternative scenarios based on shared assumptions and standardized criteria. This report presents a comparative evaluation of proposed future collider projects submitted as input for the Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. These proposals are compared considering main performance parameters, environmental impact and sustainability, technical maturity, cost of construction and operation, required human resources, and realistic implementation timelines. An overview of the international collider projects within a similar timeframe, notably the CEPC in China and the ILC in Japan is also presented, as well as a short review of the status and prospects of new accelerator techniques.",

    "title": "Reduction of SAXS Signal due to Doppler Broadening Induced Loss of Coherence",
    "abstract": "We present an analytical and numerical study of how Doppler-induced spectral broadening in laser-heated plasmas degrades the coherence of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) signals, and show that the resulting loss of temporal coherence reduces the SAXS intensity. Applying this formalism to two benchmark geometries - single density steps (wires) and periodic gratings -- we obtain analytic estimates. For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures.",

    "title": "Quasi-linear approach of bi-Kappa distributed electrons with dynamic $κ$ parameter. EMEC instability",
    "abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $κ$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $κ$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $κ$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel > 1$ ($\\parallel, \\perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $κ$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $κ$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $κ$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $κ$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.",

    "title": "Hamiltonian hydrodynamic reductions of one-dimensional Vlasov equations",
    "abstract": "We investigate Hamiltonian fluid reductions of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our approach utilizes the hydrodynamic Poisson bracket framework, which allows us to systematically identify fundamental normal variables derived from the analysis of the Casimir invariants of the resulting Poisson bracket. This framework is then applied to analyze several well-established Hamiltonian closures of the onedimensional Vlasov equation, including the multi-delta distribution and the waterbag models. Our key finding is that all of these seemingly distinct closures consistently lead to the formulation of a unified form of parametric closures: When expressed in terms of the identified normal variables, the parameterization across all these closures is revealed to be polynomial and of the same degree. All these parametric closures are uniquely generated from one of the moments, called $μ$2, a cubic polynomial in the normal variables. This result establishes a structural connection between these different physical models, offering a path toward a more unified and simplified description of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson dynamics through its reduced hydrodynamic forms with an arbitrary number of fluid variables.",

    "abstract": "The rarely used Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been utilized as an elegant way to find the trajectories of mechanical systems and to derive symplectic maps. Further, the exact solution in kick approximation of Hamilton's equations of motion in interaction representation is written as a generalized one-turn twist map.   One can imagine that the nonlinear kick comes first, followed by the one-period rotation along the machine circumference, or a second alternative in which the one-period rotation occurs before the kick. There is a difference in the result of solving Hamilton's equations between the two cases, which is expressed in obtaining a standard forward twist map in the first case, or alternatively a backward map in the second one. This nontrivial and intuitively unclear peculiarity is usually ignored/overlooked in practically all specialized references on the topic.   Finally, the statistical properties and the behavior of the density distribution of a particle beam in configuration space under the influence of an isolated sextupole have been studied.",

By varying the field asymmetry, the pulse shape from Gaussian to super-Gaussian, and the carrier envelope phase, we show the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs to exhibit extreme sensitivity to these field characteristics. The effects are also qualitatively explained by analyzing the turning-point structures within the WKB formalism. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates in the case of long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-top super-Gaussian laser profile, pair production is further facilitated. For certain field parameters, we demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude.",

    "title": "A Pathway to Sub-meV Detection of the Dark Universe: Robust Electron Avalanche in the PN junction at 10 mK",
    "abstract": "The search for light dark matter and cosmic primordial neutrinos necessitates detectors with sub-millielectronvolt (sub-meV) energy thresholds. While superconducting quantum sensors have approached this sensitivity, they often face significant challenges regarding readout complexity and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid Superconductor-Insulator-P-N (S-I-P-N) detector architecture. This concept combines the high sensitivity of superconducting Cooper pair breaking with the massive intrinsic gain of semiconductor electron avalanches. A critical prerequisite for this scheme is operation at millikelvin (mK) temperatures, raising the critical fundamental question of whether silicon PN junctions can sustain avalanche multiplication in a regime where carrier freeze-out is severe. Here, we experimentally validate the critical semiconductor amplification stage of the proposed detector. We demonstrate that Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) retain robust Geiger-mode avalanche capabilities at 10 mK. We report a single-photoelectron gain of order 10$^6$ and a dark count rate as low as 5~mHz/mm$^2$, 7 orders of magnitude lower than at room temperature. These results confirm the viability of high-gain semiconductor readout in the deep cryogenic regime, clearing the primary obstacle regarding the semiconductor component for the realization of scalable, sub-meV threshold S-I-P-N detectors.",

AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle. The results demonstrate that AAFIYA enables accurate, reproducible, and publication-ready antenna analysis, and provides a flexible foundation for future extensions, including automated optimization and data-driven antenna design.",

    "title": "Toward Ultra-fast Treatments: Large Energy Acceptance Beam Delivery Systems and Opportunities for Proton Beam Therapy",
    "abstract": "Treatment delivery is largely determined by capabilities of the beam delivery system (BDS), where faster delivery can have many potential benefits including improved dosimetric quality, utility, cost effectiveness, patient throughput and comfort. Despite significant developments in accelerators, delivery methodologies, dose optimisation and more, the energy layer switching time (ELST) is still a persisting limitation in existing BDS. The ELST can contribute significantly to beam delivery time (BDT) and extend treatment times, requiring compensation by optimisation planning approaches, motion mitigation strategies, or active beam modification. This fundamental constraint can be addressed by increasing the narrow energy acceptance range of conventional beamlines to minimise the ELST, enabling ultra-fast delivery. A large energy acceptance (LEA) BDS has the potential to revolutionise PBT through immediate improvements to current treatment delivery and emerging delivery modalities: the complete exploitation of PBT - and unlocking its full potential - can only be made possible with advances in beam delivery technologies. We review the abundant opportunities offered by an ultra-fast BDS: shorter treatment times, reduced motion induced dose degradation, improved effectiveness of motion management techniques, possibilities for volumetric rescanning, bidirectional delivery, further planning optimisation, and novel delivery strategies. We overview the design concepts of several LEA proposals, technology requirements, and also discuss the remaining challenges and considerations with realising a LEA BDS in practice. There are multiple avenues requiring further development and study, however the clinical potential and benefits of this enabling technology are clear: ultra-fast delivery offers both immediate and future improvements to PBT treatments.",

    "abstract": "Multi-turn charge-exchange injection is the primary method of creating high-intensity hadron beams in circular accelerators, and phase space painting during injection enables tailoring of the accumulated phase space distribution. A technique we call eigenpainting allows injection of particles into a single mode of a coupled ring, providing full four-dimensional control of the phase space distribution. Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring. Injecting 8.8 $μ$C of 800 MeV beam, we obtain a final ratio of intrinsic transverse emittances of $\\approx$2.4. We analyze the effect of space charge on the final distribution through comparison of the reconstructed phase space to particle-in-cell simulations.",

    "title": "A detailed and unified treatment of spin-orbit systems using tools distilled from the theory of bundles",
    "abstract": "We return to our study \\cite{BEH} of invariant spin fields and spin tunes for polarized beams in storage rings but in contrast to the continuous-time treatment in \\cite{BEH}, we now employ a discrete-time formalism, beginning with the $\\rm{Poincar\\acute{e}}$ maps of the continuous time formalism. We then substantially extend our toolset and generalize the notions of invariant spin field and invariant frame field. We revisit some old theorems and prove several theorems believed to be new. In particular we study two transformation rules, one of them known and the other new, where the former turns out to be an $SO(3)$-gauge transformation rule. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ particle bunches and their density matrix functions, describing semiclassically the particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach thus unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the spin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach relates the examples elegantly and uncovers relations between the various underlying dynamical systems in a transparent way. As in \\cite{BEH}, the particle motion is integrable but we now allow for nonlinear particle motion on each torus. Since this work is inspired by notions from the theory of bundles, we also provide insight into the underlying bundle-theoretic aspects of the well-established concepts of invariant spin field, spin tune and invariant frame field. Since we neglect, as is usual, the Stern-Gerlach force, the underlying principal bundle is of product formso that we can present the theory in a fashion which does not use bundle theory. Nevertheless we occasionally mention the bundle-theoretic meaningof our concepts and we also mention the similarities with the geometrical approach to Yang-Mills Theory.",

    "abstract": "Collisional and stochastic wave-particle dynamics in plasmas far from equilibrium are complex, temporally evolving, stochastic processes which are challenging to model. In this work, we extend previous methods coupling differentiable kinetic simulators and plasma phase space diagnostics to learn collision operators that account for time-varying background distributions. We also introduce a more general integro-differentiable operator formulation to probe relevant terms in the collision operator. To validate the proposed methodology we use data generated by self-consistent electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations. We show that both approaches recover operators that can accurately reproduce the plasma phase space dynamics while being more accurate than estimates based on particle track statistics. These results further demonstrate the potential of using differentiable simulators to infer collision operators for scenarios where no closed form solution exists or deviations from existing theory are expected.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \\leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates charge-neutral, large random density fluctuations $δn/n_0 \\gg 1$, and corresponding fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $ε$ (random plasma density grating). Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. {In the linear regime, the instability can be classified as Induced Brillouin Scattering; it is described by the parameter $ρ_L = \\left( a_0 { ω_{p}/ }ω\\right)^{2/3} \\leq 1 $, related to the Pierce parameter of Free Electron Lasers. In the cold case, the growth rate is $Γ\\approx ρ_{L} ω$ ($a_0 $ is laser nonlinearity parameter, $ω_p$ is plasma frequency, $ω$ is the laser frequency). } Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread with $Θ\\equiv k_B T/(m_e c^2) \\approx a_0^2$, restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. Time-variability of the resulting density structures does not suppress localization due to remaining corrections (not white noise).

Four silicon carbide devices are studied. Proton beams over a 1.26 to 6.00 MeV incident energy range are used to probe the active area and the depletion depth of each device. The energy loss tables for the silicon carbide material are checked, finding an empirical correction that is then used to quantify the depletion depth at the full depletion voltage through energy loss measurements of 3.40 MeV proton beams irradiating the back side of the devices.

    "title": "The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind",
    "abstract": "The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($ρ_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $ρ_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$ρ_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $ρ_e$.",

    "abstract": "We have studied radiofrequency capacitively coupled plasmas in pure O2 using single mode laser cavity ringdown spectroscopy of oxygen atoms at 630 nm. The absolute atom densities and translational temperatures were determined over a range of pressures and RF power . At pressures of 267 Pa and above, the O atom mole fraction increases with RF power and decreases with pressure, reaching a maximum of 15 percent. However, at 133 and 67 Pa it passes through a distinct maximum with power before decreasing significantly. The atom recombination processes are probed by time resolved measurements in the afterglow of pulse modulated plasmas. At 133 and 67 Pa the atom loss is dominated by surface recombination, and we see clear evidence that this rate is increased by energetic ion bombardment, in agreement with a study from Bill Graham group. This effect partially explains the observed decrease in dissociation at high RF power. The time-resolved results also allow the O negative ion density to be determined and indicate the creation of ozone in the afterglow. At 133 Pa, the trends with RF power of the O2 dissociation, O negative ion density and gas temperature suggest a transition at high power to a plasma mode with fewer high energy electrons. At higher pressures gas phase recombination mechanisms become dominant, however gas convection driven by gas cooling in the afterglow makes it complex to analyse the time-resolved data.",

By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information {as quantitative evidence}. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially exciting many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.",

    "title": "Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive PICOSEC Micromegas Detector for ENUBET",
    "abstract": "The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.",

    "title": "Accurate Simulation Pipeline for Passive Single-Photon Imaging",
    "abstract": "Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are new and promising imaging sensors. These sensors are sensitive enough to detect individual photons hitting each pixel, with extreme temporal resolution and without readout noise. Thus, SPADs stand out as an optimal choice for low-light imaging. Due to the high price and limited availability of SPAD sensors, the demand for an accurate data simulation pipeline is substantial. Indeed, the scarcity of SPAD datasets hinders the development of SPAD-specific processing algorithms and impedes the training of learning-based solutions.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive SPAD simulation pipeline and validate it with multiple experiments using two recent commercial SPAD sensors. Our simulator is used to generate the SPAD-MNIST, a single-photon version of the seminal MNIST dataset, to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers on reconstructed fluxes, even at extremely low light conditions, e.g., 5 mlux. We also assess the performance of classifiers exclusively trained on simulated data on real images acquired from SPAD sensors at different light conditions. The synthetic dataset encompasses different SPAD imaging modalities and is made available for download. Project page: https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/Projects/SPAD-MNIST.html.",

    "title": "Development of next-generation light-weight ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators",
    "abstract": "The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \\textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.",

To validate the detector design for these conditions, we constructed a module using the COSINE-100U encapsulation and performed a dedicated long-term stability study. The module was first monitored at room temperature for ~110 days in air, followed by a one-week immersion in LAB-based LS to verify initial compatibility. Upon confirming stable optical performance, the temperature was lowered to $-33^oC$. During approximately 150 days of continuous operation at low temperature, we observed no degradation in performance. These results demonstrate the chemical and mechanical robustness of the encapsulation, confirming its suitability for the COSINE-100U physics run.",

    "title": "A Neutron Microscope Using a Nested Wolter-I Condenser and a Bank of Diffractive-Refractive Achromatic Objectives",
    "abstract": "We propose a nested Wolter-I mirror design for a neutron condenser, which is based on established X-ray telescope technology. We demonstrate through simulations that it can increase the flux density at the ESS imaging instrument ODIN by up to two orders of magnitude. Experimental measurements of reflectivity and figure errors on a prototype mirror element confirm the technical feasibility of the approach. Then, we discuss design strategies for an imaging objective to fully exploit the condenser specifications while achieving spatial resolutions comparable to those of X-ray micro-CT instruments. Analytically, we show that for monochromatic beams suitable solutions exist employing arrays of hundreds of identical objectives, realized either as compound refractive lenses (CRLs) or Fresnel zone plates (FZPs). To mitigate the inherent chromatic aberration of these optics, each individual objective could be replaced by an achromatic FZP/CRL combination. Key optical properties of the resulting microscope are estimated. This novel full-field microscopy concept for highly divergent, polychromatic neutron beams has the potential to improve temporal and spatial resolution for large samples and sample environments and to enable the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of projections in neutron tomography.",

    "title": "Integrated Radiation-Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Magnetized Burning Plasmas. I. Magnetizing Ignition-Class Designs",
    "abstract": "Motivated by breakthroughs in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), first achieving ignition conditions in National Ignition Facility (NIF) shot N210808 and then laser energy breakeven in N221204, modeling efforts here investigate the effect of imposed magnetic fields on integrated hohlraum simulations of igniting systems. Previous NIF experiments have shown yield and hotspot temperature to increase in magnetized, gas-filled capsules in line with scalings. In this work, we use the 2D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Lasnex with a Livermore ICF common model. Simulations are tuned to closely approximate data from unmagnetized experiments. Investigated here is the effect of imposed axial fields of up to 100 T on the fusion output of high-performing ICF shots, specifically the record BigFoot shot N180128, and HYBRID-E shots N210808 and N221204. The main observed effect is an increase in the hotspot temperature due to magnetic insulation. Namely, electron heat flow is constrained perpendicular to the magnetic field and alpha trajectories transition to gyro-orbits, enhancing energy deposition. In addition, we investigate the impact of applied magnetic fields to future NIF designs, specifically an example Enhanced Yield Capability design with 3 MJ of laser energy as well as a high-\\r{ho}R, low implosion velocity \"Pushered Single Shell\" design. In conclusion, magnetization with field strengths of 5-75 T is found to increase the burn-averaged ion temperature by 50% and the neutron yield by 2-12. Specifically, we see yield enhancement of at least 50% with only a 5-10 T applied magnetic field for N221204, while a 65 T field on N210808 with symmetrization gives an 8 increase in yield. This is all without further design optimization to best take advantage of an applied B field, which promises even greater improvements for designs tailored specifically towards magnetization.",

    "title": "Exploring Nonlinear Drift Waves: Limiting Cases and Dynamics",
    "abstract": "A general equation for drift waves is derived incorporating both nonlinear electron density perturbation and ion vorticity effects. It is emphasized that the well-known Hasegawa-Mima (HM) equation for drift waves [A. Hasegawa and K. Mima, Phys. Fluids 21, 87 (1978)] includes only the ion vorticity term and neglects nonlinear electron density contribution that naturally arises from the electrons Boltzmann response. If ion vorticity term is ignored, then the general nonlinear equation reduces to an equation which can give two-dimensional soliton solution under an appropriate coordinate transformation. Furthermore, under the assumption that the normalized electrostatic potential depends only on one spatial coordinate along the predominant propagation direction, i.e. $Φ= Φ(y)$, the equation reduces to one-dimensional KdV equation [H. Saleem, Phys. Plasmas 31, 112102 (2024)]. Conversely, if the nonlinear electron density term is artificially suppressed and a two-dimensional potential $Φ= Φ(x, y)$ is considered, the equation reduces to Hasegawa-Mima equation supporting dipolar vortex solution. Because the HM equation ignores nonlinear electron density term, it cannot support one- or two-dimensional soliton solutions. Finally, the limiting forms of the general nonlinear equation are also briefly discussed using the reductive perturbation method (RPM).",

    "abstract": "A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.",

    "abstract": "$^{210}Po$ $α$-decay driven neutron background is a concern for many rare event search experiments. It is a difficult to control background because its radiogenic component depends on the air exposure history of parts. In this study, we demonstrate that about half of the radon progeny $^{210}Po$ can be removed from copper and silicon surfaces relatively easily by wiping a copper sample with acetone wetted tissue and a silicon detector with acetone soaked cotton balls. For a copper sample we demonstrate that long-lived $^{210}Pb$ is removed with similar effectiveness. For copper, allocated the longest counting time, additional wiping was found to be largely ineffective. For silicon, the removal effectiveness has large uncertainties. Additional cleaning showed a small but statistically significant effect. Capitalizing on this trivial cleaning step will allow experiments to relax their requirements on the allowable air exposure time during construction, leading to cost and time savings.",

    "abstract": "X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.",

    "abstract": "The physical behavior of discharges in Z pinch devices can be completely deciphered in terms of only three dimensionless parameters. These parameters can be arranged in a way that draw a surface in 3D space. This surface compiles all the accessible information on the macroscopic physical behavior of each possible Z pinch discharge. We analyze the practical problems the drawing of this surface encounters and in view of the situation, we devote the remainder of the article to outline a feasible method for estimating the plasma temperature in Z pinch discharges.",

    "title": "3D atomistic imaging of polymer nanocomposites with Atom Probe Tomography: experimental methodology, preliminary results and future outlook",
    "abstract": "The use of polymer nanocomposites as gas barrier materials has seen increasing interest, including applications involving hydrogen transport and storage. Better understanding of gas transport through those polymeric systems requires 3D nanoscale detection of distributions and the possible trapping of gas molecules within nanoparticles and polymer/nanoparticle interfaces While atom probe tomography (APT) offers promising means for such nanoscale characterisation, its use for polymers has been mainly limited to thin organic layers deposited onto substrates or pre-fabricated metal needle shaped specimens. This work provides the very first application of APT to bulk polymer nanocomposites. Particularly, site specific atom probe sample preparation by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) liftout has been shown for the first time in a model system of hexagonal boron nanoparticles within a PVDF polymer matrix, using a variety of FIB workflows including Xe FIB, Ga FIB, cryogenic Ga FIB and deuterium charging. Mass spectra from the bulk polymer and the nanoparticle were collected using pulsed laser atom probe using standard conditions and compared. Several challenges encountered during this research including damage of the polymeric matrix during sample preparation were extensively discussed in this paper. Once those challenges have been resolved (e.g. by developing site specific sample preparation protocols), the application of APT to polymer nanocomposites can open new options for nanoscale characterisation of those systems.",

    "title": "Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging",
    "abstract": "The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.",

    "title": "Direct in-chamber radon-220 (thoron) emanation measurements for rare-event physics experiments",
    "abstract": "Measuring radon emanation from detector materials is a key method for controlling radon, a significant background in rare-event physics experiments. Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn.",

    "title": "Deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates of global hybrid-Vlasov simulations",
    "abstract": "Hybrid-Vlasov simulations resolve ion-kinetic effects for modeling the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, but even 5D (2D + 3V) simulations are computationally expensive. We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.",

    "title": "Design Optimization of Triple Gas Electron Multiplier for Superior Gain and Reduced Ion Backflow",
    "abstract": "Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) are extensively employed in modern high-energy and nuclear Physics experiments because of their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capability, and operational stability. Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$. The potential enhancements in detector efficiency and stability that the proposed modifications to the GEM foil geometry offers a valuable insights for the design of next-generation gaseous detectors.",

We measured a single photon angular resolution of 3.8~mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value of 242~mrad, as well as the expected scaling of the angular resolution with the increasing number of detected photons. We also studied the contribution of uncorrelated and correlated background sources with respect to the signal and proved the effectiveness of time matching between charged tracks and photon hits to achieve efficient suppression of the SiPM dark count rate background.

    "abstract": "Intervals of enhanced turbulent fluctuations are typically less frequent within the magnetic cloud region of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We investigate two such intervals inside an ICME observed by the \\textit{Wind} spacecraft on 8--9 June 2000 and characterize their associated wave populations. We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.",

    "abstract": "Non-axisymmetric magnetic field coils have been designed to provide efficient error field correction and suppress edge localized modes in SPARC - a compact high-field tokamak that is presently under construction at Commonwealth Fusion Systems. These designs utilize the Generalized Perturbed Equilibrium Code's (GPEC's) representation of the multi-modal, non-axisymmetric plasma response to optimize the geometric coupling between 3D coil arrays and the desired core or edge plasma response. Error field correction coils are designed to couple to the plasma-amplified kink that dominates the drive of core resonances. The maximum allowable error field is projected to SPARC using an empirical scaling that is consistent with linear and nonlinear MHD modeling expectations. Asymmetric construction and assembly tolerances are then balanced against the corresponding kA-turns needed for correction to levels below the allowable limit. These physics-driven coil designs provide confidence in our ability to operate SPARC in new high field tokamak regimes without error field induced locked modes.",

    "title": "Plasmoid formation via competing lower-hybrid drift and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities: A hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic simulation study",
    "abstract": "We investigate the nonlinear formation of plasmoids in 2D low-beta current sheets through the interplay between the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.",
