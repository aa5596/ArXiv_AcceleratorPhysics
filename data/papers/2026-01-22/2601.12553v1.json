  "title": "Design Optimization of Triple Gas Electron Multiplier for Superior Gain and Reduced Ion Backflow",
  "abstract": "Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) are extensively employed in modern high-energy and nuclear Physics experiments because of their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capability, and operational stability. Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$. The potential enhancements in detector efficiency and stability that the proposed modifications to the GEM foil geometry offers a valuable insights for the design of next-generation gaseous detectors.",
