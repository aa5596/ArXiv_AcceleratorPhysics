  "title": "Frequency stability of $2.5\\times10^{-17}$ in a Si cavity with AlGaAs   crystalline mirrors",
  "abstract": "Developments in ultrastable lasers have fueled remarkable advances in optical frequency metrology and quantum science. A key ingredient in further improving laser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as AlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings limits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to similar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair of crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated at 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over dielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \\times 10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and corresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss factor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency averaging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency drift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years. These results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with $10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with continuously operating optical local oscillators.",
