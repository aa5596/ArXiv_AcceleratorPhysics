  "title": "Consideration of REBCO rapid-cycling diploe magnet for staged muon   acceleration",
  "abstract": "A possible application of the HTS (ReBCO) rapid-cycling dipole magnet [1] in the first stages of muon acceleration consisting of Recirculating Linear Accelerator (RLA) and followed-up first Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS-1) is presented. The projected ReBCO magnet hysteresis loss is discussed in terms of the liquid helium coolant choice and the option with the striated ReBCO conductor for the further significant reduction of the hysteresis power loss.",
