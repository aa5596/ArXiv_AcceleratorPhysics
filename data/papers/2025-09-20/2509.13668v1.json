  "title": "Phase Transition Dynamics Induced by Strong Radio-Frequency Fields in   ReBCO High Temperature Superconductors",
  "abstract": "Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.",
