  "title": "Detectability of Covert Fissile Material Production in Nuclear Fusion   Reactors via Antineutrino Emissions",
  "abstract": "Fusion power systems can in principle be used to make significant amounts of fissile material. To do so, an operator would have to introduce fertile material, such as uranium-238, in a suitable region of the reactor where it is exposed to an intense neutron flux. The possibility of using a fusion reactor for this purpose has raised the question of how these facilities can be monitored to ensure their peaceful use. This study examines whether covert production of fissile material in a declared fusion plant could be detected with an onsite antineutrino detector. We find that even a relatively small detector should be able to confirm production rates of a few kilograms of plutonium over 30 days, despite the cosmogenic background and the antineutrino emissions associated with neutron activation of reactor components.",
