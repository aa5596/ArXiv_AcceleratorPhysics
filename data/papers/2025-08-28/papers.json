    "title": "Multiphysics Analysis of Cryogenically Cooled Photocathode in a CW SRF   Injector cavity",
    "abstract": "The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at higher laser loads will benefit from further dedicated cryogenic analysis.",

    "abstract": "ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments. ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17 kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.",

    "title": "Optimization of 3D diamond detectors with graphitized electrodes based   on an innovative numerical simulation",
    "abstract": "Future experiments at hadron colliders require an evolution of the tracking sensors to ensure sufficient radiation hardness as well as space and time resolution to handle unprecedented particle fluxes. 3D diamond sensors with laser-graphitized electrodes are promising candidates due to their strong binding energy, small atomic number, and high carrier mobility. However, the high resistance of the engraved electrodes delays the propagation of the induced signals towards the readout electronics, thereby degrading the precision of the timing measurements. So far, this effect has been the dominant factor limiting the time resolution of these devices, with other contributions, such as those due to electric field inhomogeneities or electronic noise, typically neglected. Recent advancements in graphitization technology, however, motivate a renewed effort in modeling signal generation in 3D diamond detectors, to achieve more reliable predictions. To this purpose, we apply an extended version of the Ramo-Shockley theorem describing the effect of signal propagation as a time-dependent weighting potential, obtained by solving numerically the Maxwell's equations in a quasi-static approximation. We developed a custom spectral method solver and validated it against COMSOL MultiPhysics. The response of the modeled sensor to a beam of particles is then simulated using Garfield++ and is compared to the data acquired in a beam test carried on in 2021 by the TimeSPOT Collaboration at the SPS, at CERN. Based on the results obtained with this simulation workflow, we conclude that reducing the resistivity of the graphitic columns remains the priority for significantly improving the time resolution of 3D diamond detectors. Once achieved, optimization of the detector geometry and readout electronics design will become equally important steps to further enhance the timing performance of these devices.",

    "abstract": "The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is searching for dark matter interactions in a liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXe-TPC). This article demonstrates how control of the flow state in the LXe-TPC enables the identification of pairs of sequential alpha-decays, which are used to map fluid flow and ion drift in the liquid target. The resulting transport model is used to tag $^{214}$Pb beta-decays, a leading background to dark matter signals in LZ. Temporally evolving volume selections, at a cost of 9.0% of exposure, target the decay of each $^{214}$Pb atom up to 81 minutes after production, resulting in (63 $\\pm$ 6$_{\\mathrm{stat}}$ $\\pm$ 7$_{\\mathrm{sys}}$)% identification of $^{214}$Pb decays to ground state. We also demonstrate how flow-based tagging techniques enable a novel calibration side band that is concurrent with science data.",

    "title": "First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference   Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting   Layer Beams",
    "abstract": "This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.",

    "abstract": "Attosecond X-ray pulses are indispensable for exploring ultrafast phenomena in matter on the \\AA{}ngstrom--attosecond scale. Especially, attosecond--pump attosecond--probe experiments could enable the study of electron dynamics in real time. Here, we advance this technique by proposing the production of double attosecond hard X-ray pulses with distinct topological charges using an X-ray free-electron laser. By leveraging transverse-mode frequency pulling, we show the formation of double attosecond pulses with varying topological charges, demonstrated by three-dimensional simulations. The resulting double pulses exhibit two temporally separated peaks with a delay of several hundred attoseconds. This capability opens new avenues for sub-femtosecond pump-probe experiments, leveraging both the temporal and topological degrees of freedom in attosecond X-ray science.",

    "abstract": "We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.",

    "title": "Free electron charging of microdroplets in a plasma at atmospheric   pressure",
    "abstract": "Gas phase microdroplets have recently demonstrated exceptional chemical properties via suspected mechanisms such as contact electrification and surface charge pinning leading, in turn, to high electric fields at the surface. In this work, microdroplets are injected into a low temperature flowing gas plasma at atmospheric pressure and during flight they are subject to an excess free electron flux. We report the first measurements of particle charge acquired in a fully collisional plasma with average values up to $2.5 \\times 10^{5}$ electrons, dependent on absorbed power, for droplets with an average diameter of $15~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Simulations indicate that for similar plasma conditions, the acquired charge on solid particles would be $\\sim40\\%$ lower, at $1.5 \\times 10^{5}$ electrons, with the difference likely due in part to low mobility water cluster ion formation around the evaporating droplet. Simulations also indicate surface electric fields up to $1 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}$ for the smallest droplets ($3~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$). The formation of H$_2$O$_2$ was observed in the liquid with measured values up to 33 mM, equivalent to a remarkable generation rate of over $275~\\mathrm{M\\,s^{-1}}$. The microdroplet system involves a complex interplay of various potential mechanisms, yet to be elucidated. The inclusion of a controlled plasma environment offers the capability for creating known charge levels and defined exposure times to allow more systematic study as well as enhancing their already exceptional characteristics.",

    "title": "Ice-assisted soft-landing deposition for van der Waals integration",
    "abstract": "Van der Waals integration enables the creation of electronic and optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and novel functionalities beyond the existing material limitations. However, it is typically realized using a physical pick-up-and-place process to minimize interfacial damages and is hardly integrated into conventional lithography and metallization procedures. Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der Waals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer layer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during metallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently and in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and damage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and non-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which is extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect transistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2 V-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate the batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform electrical characteristics. Such a gentle and ultra-clean fabrication approach has been further extended to materials with high reactivity, such as halide perovskites. Our method can be easily integrated with mature semiconductor manufacturing technology and may become a generic strategy for fabricating van der Waals contacted devices.",

    "abstract": "The LEGEND experiment is looking for the extremely rare neutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge using isotopically-enriched high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. The detection of this process would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana particle and the total lepton number would not be conserved, which could be related to the cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter through leptogenesis. The long-term goal of the collaboration is LEGEND-1000: a 1-ton detector array planned to run for 10 years, with a projected half-life sensitivity exceeding $10^{28}$ years, fully covering the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. A first search for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay has been carried out by LEGEND-200 building on the experience gained from GERDA and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The experiment has been collecting physics data for a year at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy with 140 kg of HPGe detectors. With a total exposure of 61 kg yr, LEGEND-200 has achieved a background index of $5^{+3}_{-2}\\times10^{-4}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay signal region from the highest performing detectors. After combining the results from GERDA, the MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200, an exclusion sensitivity $ > 2.8\\times10^{26}$ yr has been obtained at 90\\% confidence level for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half-life, with no evidence for a signal.

    "abstract": "The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation $e^+e^-$ collider to enable high-precision studies of the Higgs boson and potential new physics, imposes rigorous demands on detector technologies, particularly the vertex detector. JadePix-3 is a prototype Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) designed for the CEPC vertex detector. This paper presents a detailed laboratory-based characterization of the JadePix-3 sensor, focusing on the previously under-explored effects of substrate reverse bias voltage on key performance metrics: charge collection efficiency, average cluster size, and detection efficiency. Systematic testing demonstrated that JadePix-3 operates reliably under reverse bias, exhibiting a reduced input capacitance, an expanded depletion region, enhanced charge collection efficiency, and a lower fake-hit rate. These findings confirm the sensor's potential for high-precision particle tracking and vertexing at the CEPC while offering valuable references for future iterational R\\&D of the JadePix series.",

    "abstract": "Mu2e, the Muon-to-Electron Conversion Experiment, aims to identify physics beyond the Standard Model, namely, the conversion of muons to electrons without the emission of neutrinos. The muons are produced from pions generated in a production target when it is hit by an 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster/Main Injector. The proton target design space is strongly constrained by a one-year operating lifetime and the need for radiative cooling in a vacuum environment. Uncertainties in the lifetime of the existing baseline design - a monolithic, segmented tungsten target - are large, particularly due to unknown impacts of radiation damage at the very high proton fluences expected in the experiment. We have begun evaluation of a new design utilizing Inconel 718 over the WL10 used in the existing target design. As a result, the structural design of the target has evolved significantly. This evolution focuses on lowering the target temperature, minimizing obstruction to muons, increasing structural stability, maximizing fatigue lifetime, simplifying the fabrication process, and more. The thermal management, structural stability and fatigue lifetime are emphasized here. These optimizations have led to a promising new target design for the Mu2e experiment.",

The origin of the noise has remained unknown, and in the past two years, has become an overwhelming background for low-threshold dark matter searches aimed at O(10) GeV dark matter particle masses, as well as measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering of 8B solar neutrinos. We have performed a comprehensive series of tests in a small liquid xenon cell at LBL, from which we conclude that the dominant component of this delayed photon noise is due to UV-induced fluorescence of quartz photosensor windows.",

    "title": "Three-dimensional hyperspectral imaging with optical microcombs",
    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs have revolutionised time and frequency metrology [1, 2]. The advent of microresonator-based frequency combs ('microcombs' [3-5]) is set to lead to the miniaturisation of devices that are ideally suited to a wide range of applications, including microwave generation [6, 7], ranging [8-10], the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs [11], neuromorphic computing [12, 13], high-bandwidth data communications[14], and quantum-optics [15, 16] platforms. Here, we introduce a new microcomb application for three-dimensional imaging. Our method can simultaneously determine the chemical identity and full three-dimensional geometry, including size, shape, depth, and spatial coordinates, of particulate matter ranging from micrometres to millimetres in size across nearly $10^5$ distinct image pixels. We demonstrate our technique using millimetre-sized plastic specimens (i.e. microplastics measuring less than 5 mm). We combine amplitude and phase analysis and achieve a throughput exceeding $1.2~10^6$ pixels per second with micrometre-scale precision. Our method leverages the defining feature of microcombs - their large line spacing - to enable precise spectral diagnostics using microcombs with a repetition frequency of 1 THz. Our results suggest scalable operation over several million pixels and nanometre-scale axial resolution. Coupled with its high-speed, label-free and multiplexed capabilities, our approach provides a promising basis for environmental sensing, particularly for the real-time detection and characterisation of microplastic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems [17].",

The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this study, we present a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by bundling the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of approximately 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. To validate this concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity comprising six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, achieving results in good agreement with numerical simulations.",

    "title": "Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface",
    "abstract": "A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.",

This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.",

    "abstract": "A new three-dimensional, non-linear Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model has been extended in MIPS code, incorporating parallel heat diffusivity. The model has been benchmarked against the former MHD model used in MIPS code. A preliminary study of the core density collapse event (CDC) observed in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasma has been performed using the developed model. The equilibrium has been constructed using HINT code for a typical super dense core discharge in LHD, with vacuum magnetic axis configuration RaxV = 3.85 m and magnetic axis beta \\beta0 = 4% plasma. This configuration corresponds to a plasma with a steep pressure gradient and strong Shafranov shift, which makes the plasma potentially unstable in the LHD. The model shows preliminary characteristics of the CDC event. The plasma is destabilized by high-n ballooning modes in the low-field side region during the linear regime, eventually leading to the collapse of the pressure and density profiles, together with the stochastization of the magnetic field and a shift to low-n modes centered at the core of the plasma after the non-linear coupling at the relaxation regime.",

    "title": "First stave results towards mitigating sensor fracturing with   interposers in the ATLAS ITk strips barrel",
    "abstract": "At the conclusion of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the accelerator complex will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), allowing it to increase the dataset sizes of LHC experiments by about a factor of 20. This significant increase in dataset size will improve the sensitivity and precision of all physics analyses from LHC experiments, but will come with a more challenging data-taking environment. In order to handle this, the ATLAS detector will undergo a substantial upgrade, including an upgrade of its inner tracker to an all-silicon tracker called the Inner Tracker (ITk), made of pixel and strip sub-detectors. During the pre-production phase of the ITk strips, it was discovered that thermally cycling modules loaded onto local support structures led to physical fractures in silicon sensors due to the induced thermal stress. This is understood to be the result of several factors, including the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion between the different module layers, and the close proximity of the module electrical components. Several mitigation strategies were tested to reduce the rate of module fracturing. This paper describes the assembly setup, testing setups, and electrical testing results of ITk strips barrel modules loaded onto local support structures. 69 of 70 modules with an in-built additional kapton layer were found to survive testing down to -70{\\deg}C.",

These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\\bf V} = \\wh{\\sf z}\\btimes\\nabla\\phi + V_{z}\\,\\wh{\\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\\bf B} = \\nabla\\psi\\btimes\\wh{\\sf z} + B_{z}\\,\\wh{\\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \\partial\\psi/\\partial y, B_{y} = -\\,\\partial\\psi/\\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\\phi,\\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.",

    "title": "Enhanced Terahertz Generation via Oblique Incidence of Unipolar Laser   Pulses on Plasma",
    "abstract": "We investigate terahertz (THz) radiation generation at the vacuum-plasma interface driven by the oblique incidence of s-polarized Gaussian laser pulse(s) on a semi-infinite underdense plasma.~Extending beyond the conventional single-frequency bipolar pulse (B-pulse), this work focuses on leveraging two-color mixed-frequency pulse-- (M-pulse) excitation to enhance THz performance in terms of strength and broadening that can be tuned through controlled amplitude and phase of the constituent pulses of the M-pulse. A new expression for the ponderomotive force (PF) -- which acts as the main driver of THz radiation at the vacuum-plasma boundary -- is derived to capture the hitherto unexplored effects of phase asymmetry intrinsic to the M-pulse, in contrast to a single B-pulse where its phase is irrelevant. This PF formulation captures the underlying cycle-to-cycle symmetry-breaking for the M-pulse field, responsible for efficient THz emission. We demonstrate analytically that such M-pulses of the same total energy as a B-pulse may generate significantly enhanced PF, leading to THz yields several orders of magnitude higher. With a judicious choice of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, the M-pulse configuration is shown to emerge as a highly efficient, phase-controllable driver of   THz radiation and offers a promising route for optimizing THz source design via tailored two-color laser-plasma interactions.",

    "abstract": "Salient aspects of the commissioning, calibration, and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker are discussed, drawing on experience during operation with proton-proton collisions delivered by the CERN LHC. The data were obtained with a variety of luminosities. The operating temperature of the strip tracker was changed several times during this period and results are shown as a function of temperature in several cases. Details of the system performance are presented, including occupancy, signal-to-noise ratio, Lorentz angle, and single-hit spatial resolution. Saturation effects in the APV25 readout chip preamplifier observed during early Run 2 are presented, showing the effect on various observables and the subsequent remedy. Studies of radiation effects on the strip tracker are presented both for the optical readout links and the silicon sensors. The observed effects are compared to simulation, where available, and they generally agree well with expectations.",

    "title": "Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with   exponentially fewer time-steps",
    "abstract": "The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. We introduce novel vector-norm analysis and prove that the number of time-steps can be reduced by a factor exponential in the number of qubits compared to previously established operator-norm analysis, thereby significantly lowering the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100 mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\\le$0.5 eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\\circ$C, a laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was $\\beta$-FeSe[100]$\\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of $\\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering.",

    "title": "Landau damping and the long-time collisionless limit of the   Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equation",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equations on $\\mathbb{T}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ with small collision frequency $\\nu\\ll 1$. We prove that for $\\nu$-independent perturbations of the global Maxwellians in Gevrey-$2_-$, solutions display uniform-in-$\\nu$ Landau damping and enhanced dissipation. Moreover, the collisionless limit holds, that is, as $\\nu\\to 0_+$ for $0<t\\ll \\nu^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$, the $\\nu > 0$ solutions converge uniformly (and in much stronger norms) to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with the same initial data. To our knowledge, this work is hence the first justification that the collisionless prediction matches those of collisional plasmas in the nonlinear equations.   The interaction between Landau damping and collisions requires several new ideas:   (1) an infinite-regularity commuting vector field method, merged with Guo's weighted energy methods for the Landau operator and hypocoercivity to extract the enhanced dissipation;   (2) A novel nearly-physical side treatment of the collisionless Vlasov echoes;   (3) A new set of decomposition methods to treat the effects of the nonlinear collisions in the Volterra equation for the density (i.e., the ``collisional echoes'')   (4) A new quasi-linearization method for treating the effect of the slowly evolving homogeneous modes over long times.   As a side result, we also prove Landau damping and enhanced dissipation of $O(\\epsilon\\nu^{1/3})$ Sobolev-space perturbations of homogeneous distributions that are only $O(\\epsilon)$ perturbations of global Maxwellians, generalizing the recent results of Chaturvedi, Luk, and Nguyen. As another side result, our methods also provide a nearly-completely physical-side proof of Mouhot and Villani's theorem in the full range of Gevrey-$3_-$.",

    "title": "An improved nonlocal electron heat transport model for magnetized   plasmas",
    "abstract": "Distortions in the electron distribution function driven by intense temperature gradients critically influence the generation and evolution of heat flux and magnetic fields in plasmas under the condition of inertial confinement fusion. Describing such kinetic behaviors at large spatiotemporal scales typically requires multigroup models based on simplified Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. However, the accuracy of existing multigroup models remains uncertain, without a well-defined methodology for implementing nonlocal magnetic field corrections. This paper develops an improved nonlocal multigroup model for magnetized plasmas. The advancements comprise: (i) a revised source term in the diffusion equations, (ii) a Biermann-producing electric field equation incorporating the density perturbation, and (iii) a nonlocal correction method for the Nernst velocity. The numerical method for the anisotropic heat conduction equation is analyzed, and three test cases demonstrate that the model accurately predicts the key phenomena arising from nonlocal effects in magnetized plasmas.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high-intensity radioactive ion beams has opened new avenues for nuclear structure research. By studying exotic ions, phenomena such as shell evolution, halos, and the limits of stability have been studied. In particular, Quasi-Free Scattering (QFS) experiments on hydrogen targets have proven to be a valuable tool to investigate the structure of exotic ions. Recently, a series of QFS experiments were performed at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) of the RIKEN Nishina Center employing the MINOS liquid hydrogen system. A fundamental part of the success of these experiments was the use of dedicated devices to measure the gamma-rays, charged particles, and neutrons emitted in the reactions. The experience gained during the past campaigns, as well as the upcoming upgrade of the RIBF facility call for improvements on the existing devices, as well as for the development of new detection systems. Here we review the main detection devices used at the RIBF for QFS experiments, and give an overview of the ongoing and upcoming developments.",

    "title": "Terahertz-Driven Nano-tip Field-Emission Electron Gun and Cascaded   Acceleration",
    "abstract": "This paper reports two versions of terahertz (THz)-driven nanotip field-emission electron guns: single-layer reflective guns (SLRGs) and double-layer reflective guns (DLRGs). Both guns use nanotip emitters and accelerate electrons through the electric field of the THz wave. SLRGs employ a reflective structure to superimpose the initial and subsequent half-cycles of the THz electric field, enhancing the field amplitude and acceleration efficiency. Experiments have demonstrated that SLRGs achieve higher acceleration efficiency than single-layer nonreflective guns (SLNRGs) for identical THz input energies. This constitutes direct experimental verification of the efficacy of the reflective structure. Theoretically, SLRGs operating in single-feed mode can match the acceleration efficiency of dual-feed SLNRGs while reducing operational complexity. DLRGs demonstrate THz-driven cascaded electron acceleration through precise scanning of the delay between two incident THz beams. This represents a direct experimental demonstration of cascaded acceleration in THz-driven electron sources. The experimental results of DLRGs align closely with the results of electron dynamics predicted by simulations. This establishes the foundation for developing multilayer high-acceleration-efficiency THz-driven high-energy electron guns. The ability to manipulate the THz for each layer individually holds promising potential for improving the beam quality of THz electron guns.",

The amplitude of initial perturbations, $Pm$ and domain aspect ratio play a key role in the onset and evolution of the dynamo.

    "title": "Optics for broadband x-ray ptychography",
    "abstract": "In conventional x-ray ptychography, diffraction data is collected by scanning a sample through a monochromatic, and spatially coherent, x-ray beam. A high-resolution image is then retrieved using an iterative algorithm. Combined with a scan of the incident photon energy, it is also possible to access chemical and elemental information. Although powerful, the high brilliance required currently constrains the method to 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron sources and long scanning times. An alternative approach is to use a broadband illumination in combination with an energy resolving detector. These detectors record the data in a series of energy channels simultaneously, creating a stack of coherent data suitable for a ptychographic reconstruction. This approach promises to unlock the full power of the radiation source and provide spectral imaging at a higher rate and in a single acquisition. However, these detectors currently saturate well below reaching the flux rates produced at synchrotrons, which is preventing the uptake of this approach. Furthermore, current monochromatic synchrotron setups typically employ Fresnel zone plates for pre-sample focusing due to their stability, flexibility, and affordability, but these diffractive optics limit the spectral bandwidth that the setup can accept. In this article, we analyze the problem and consider alternative optics that can both maximize the total photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth. Broadband x-ray ptychography has the potential to dramatically reduce data collection times at synchrotron sources, but also to harness the full power of lower brilliance sources and transition x-ray ptychography into a laboratory technique.",

This suppression of the growth rate of two stream instability is consistent even when the ions form a neutralizing background. It is found that the parameter space of the growth rate reasonably squeezes for relativistic electrons at higher plasma frequencies. We further report the suppression of the growth rate of the said instability as the ion electron mass ratio reaches the realistic limit. Our results have implications for high-energy plasmas, laser-plasma interactions, and relativistic particle beam physics, providing insights into the complex interplay of linear and nonlinear processes governing the two-stream instability. Our unified four-regime analysis extends previous understanding of how realistic mass ratios fundamentally modify relativistic suppression effects, providing essential scaling laws for high-energy plasma applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for aligning a laser ionized plasma source to a pair of ultra-relativistic electron beams that comprise a plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA). We achieve alignment by analyzing the plasma afterglow light observed at two longitudinal locations as the plasma column is scanned across the electron beam. By analyzing the relative plasma light intensity at the two locations, we aligned an 85-cm plasma source to a 10 GeV, 1.6 nC electron beam to within 10 um offset, 10 urad tilt. The alignment is verified by analyzing the drive beam energy loss, energy transfer efficiency, and the witness beam energy gain as a function of the misalignment between the beams and the plasma. From this measurement, we extract the alignment tolerance required between the laser-ionized plasma source and electron beams, an important metric necessary for collider design studies or light source applications based on a laser-ionized plasma source.",

    "title": "Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment",
    "abstract": "Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.",

    "title": "Bayesian Optimisation of Breit-Wheeler Pair Production in Simulated   Laser Experiments",
    "abstract": "High laser intensities enable the production of electron-positron pairs from bright gamma rays passing through strong fields. Potentially the most promising approach for all-optical experiments in the near term uses dense but higher divergence electron beams from laser wakefield acceleration to produce gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. Achieving many-photon collisions between these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is extremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser pointing and timing.   We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo experiments. By using a more efficient algorithm for sampling infrequent pair production with particle splitting, we enable the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using Gaussian Process Regression we then efficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing the laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off distance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding laser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the degree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing electron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising the energy in the gamma rays. With \\unit[100]{J} of laser energy, we estimate rates of pair production of around 1 pair per 100 electrons are achievable even with jitter of 10s of microns and 10s of femtoseconds.",

Scintillating filaments, based on polystyrene doped with \\emph{p}-terphenyl and 1,4-bis (5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) benzene, and enriched with $^6$LiF to enable neutron sensitivity were manufactured in house and achieved visible scintillation with a light output of 30$\\pm$5~photons per MeV.

The detector performance was compared with Geant4 simulations of the scintillating sensor's response to electrons, gamma-rays, and thermal neutrons. A novel event discrimination algorithm, using the properties of the TimePix3 camera, enabled the separation of neutron signatures from the gamma-ray background.",

The particles are loaded and stored in the trap under various conditions followed by detection employing an electron multiplier tube. We find that tens of electrons or ions can be trapped for up to ten milliseconds and a small fraction remains trapped even after hundreds of milliseconds. During dual-frequency operation we find that while the number of trapped electrons rapidly decreases with increase of the $\\Omega_\\textrm{slow}$ field amplitude, the number of trapped ions shows no dependence on the $\\Omega_\\textrm{fast}$ field amplitude as supported by our extensive numerical simulations. We aim to use a similar trap for synthesising antihydrogen from antiprotons and positrons.

To do so, an operator would have to introduce fertile material, such as uranium-238, in a suitable region of the reactor where it is exposed to an intense neutron flux. The possibility of using a fusion reactor for this purpose has raised the question of how these facilities can be monitored to ensure their peaceful use. This study examines whether covert production of fissile material in a declared fusion plant could be detected with an onsite antineutrino detector. We find that even a relatively small detector should be able to confirm production rates of a few kilograms of plutonium over 30 days, despite the cosmogenic background and the antineutrino emissions associated with neutron activation of reactor components.",

    "title": "Identification of Nonlinear Damping of Transverse Loop Oscillations by   KHI-induced Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Kink oscillations in coronal loops have been extensively studied for their potential contributions to coronal heating and their role in plasma diagnostics through coronal seismology. A key focus is the strong damping of large-amplitude kink oscillations, which observational evidence suggests is nonlinear. However, directly identifying the nonlinearity is a challenge. This work presents an analytic formula describing nonlinear standing kink oscillations dissipated by turbulence, characterised by a time-varying damping rate and period drift. We investigate how the damping behaviour depends on the driving amplitude and loop properties, showing that the initial damping time $\\tau$ is inversely proportional to the velocity disturbance over the loop radius, $V_i/R$. Using MCMC fitting with Bayesian inference, the nonlinear function better fits an observed decaying kink oscillation than traditional linear models, including exponential damping, suggesting its nonlinear nature. By applying a Bayesian model comparison, we establish regimes in which nonlinear and linear resonant absorption mechanisms dominate based on the relationship between the damping rate $\\tau/P$ and $V_i/R$. Additionally, analysis of two specific events reveals that while one favours the nonlinear model, the other is better explained by the linear model. Our results suggest that this analytical approximation of nonlinear damping due to turbulence provides a valid and reliable description of large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations in coronal loops.",

    "title": "A two-prong Approach to the Simulation of DC-RSD: TCAD and Spice",
    "abstract": "The DC-coupled Resistive Silicon Detectors (DCRSD) are the evolution of the AC-coupled RSD (RSD) design, both based on the Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology. The DC-RSD design concept intends to address a few known issues present in RSDs (e.g., baseline fluctuation, long tail-bipolar signals) while maintaining their advantages (e.g., signal spreading, 100% fill factor). The simulation of DC-RSD presents several unique challenges linked to the complex nature of its design and the large pixel size. The defining feature of DC-RSD, charge sharing over distances that can be as large as a millimeter, represents a formidable challenge for Technology-CAD (TCAD), the standard simulation tool. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a mixed-mode approach to the DC-RSD simulation, which exploits a combination of two simulation tools: TCAD and Spice. Thanks to this hybrid approach, it has been possible to demonstrate that, according to the simulation, the key features of the RSD, excellent timing and spatial resolutions (few tens of picoseconds and few microns), are maintained in the DC-RSD design. In this work, we present the developed models and methodology, mainly showing the results of device-level numerical simulation, which have been obtained with the state-of-the-art Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD suite of tools. Such results will provide all the necessary information for the first batch of DC-RSD produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) foundry in Trento, Italy.",

Two subsystems with mass, momentum, and energy conservation are obtained by a Poisson bracket-based splitting method. For the subsystem in which the distribution functions and the fields are coupled, the second order and reversible modified implicit mid-point rule is used in time with the specially designed mean velocity. The distribution functions are not involved in the iterations and are solved by exact splittings with only one dimensional advections, which makes the proposed schemes efficient. The cancellation problem is overcome by the numerical schemes constructed. Moreover, for the case with a periodic boundary condition, the magnetic field obtained is divergence free, mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The methods can be extended to cases with multiple ion species.",

    "title": "A rigorous study on the longitudinal beam coupling impedance of a   cylindrical lossy pipe in normal and anomalous regimes",
    "abstract": "One of the primary issues in designing particle accelerators is the effect of energy losses and collective instabilities caused by the conductivity of the vacuum chamber. Due to its relevance, many authors have long focused on studying the coupling impedance of lossy pipes with various geometries and metals. Most studies were developed for relativistic beams and room-temperature conductivity. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the high-frequency impedance behavior of ultra-short bunches, as in the case of FELs, and in the anomalous conductivity at cryogenic temperatures of the vacuum chambers. This work introduces a new unifying theoretical framework for analyzing electromagnetic interactions in cylindrical pipes excited by charged particles traveling on the axis. In this context, a key achievement is the derivation of a rigorous expression for the electric conductivity, based on the Boltzmann theory of a Fermi gas, which forms the foundation for subsequent developments. New formulas for the surface impedance of cylindrical pipes are presented, from which a more general impedance expression is derived. Our approach captures the system's behavior across various energy and frequency regimes. Eventually, the anomalous regime is studied rigorously, providing analytical solutions for the electromagnetic field at cryogenic temperatures. Indeed, new and exact expressions for the anomalous surface impedance for carriers' reflection coefficients p = 0 and p = 1 are obtained, offering deeper insight into the electromagnetic properties of such systems under extreme conditions.",

    "abstract": "Structured {\\gamma} rays, particularly cylindrical vector {\\gamma} rays, offer promising tools for sub-nuclear imaging and polarization-sensitive probes in fundamental research and applications, but conventional optical methods face great challenges at such photon energy. Here, we put forward a novel method generating such {\\gamma} rays through relativistic beam-target interactions. For instance, radially polarized {\\gamma} rays can be generated by using a dense electron beam striking a multifoil target. We find that the radial polarization is transferred from the generated coherent transition radiation (CTR) fields to $\\gamma$ photons through nonlinear Compton scattering, with the high polarization preserved by phase matching. Three-dimensional spin-resolved simulations demonstrate radial polarization degrees approaching 60\\%. Furthermore, these {\\gamma} rays can decay into azimuthally spin-polarized positrons via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process, with their spins aligning along the CTR magnetic field. Our work extends the concept of structured light into the {\\gamma}-ray regime, offering new prospects for broad fields such as nuclear structure probing, fundamental symmetries tests, polarization-sensitive studies in extreme conditions, and laboratory astrophysical observations.",

This assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel (PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced X-Defect.

    "title": "A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio   wave propagation",
    "abstract": "Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.",

    "title": "Mapping the Photon Detection Efficiency of VUV Sensitive SiPMs from the   Ultra-Violet to the Near Infra-Red",
    "abstract": "We present a flexible analytic model describing the Photo-Detection Efficiency (PDE) for P-on-N silicon photomultipliers. This model can be used for device characterization, PDE extrapolation from limited data or design optimization. The model uses six device specific parameters to describe PDE for a large range of wavelengths, angles of incidence, voltages and temperatures. Refractive index data taken from literature are inputs to the model, which also allows the prediction of PDE for devices operated in dense media. We present the measurement of the absolute PDE from 350-830~nm at 163~K for two UV sensitive devices: Hamamatsu VUV4 and the Fondazione Bruno Kessler VUV-HD3. Additional measurements of relative PDE versus angle are performed. We successfully fit the model to the data and show its predictive power, extrapolating the PDE to new wavelengths and to operation in liquid argon and xenon. Lastly we investigate optimizing efficiency for specific applications in astroparticle physics and quantum computing.",
