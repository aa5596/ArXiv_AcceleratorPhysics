  "title": "Spiral Tuning of Wire-metamaterial Cavity for Plasma Haloscope",
  "abstract": "Axions are hypothetical particles that provide a compelling solution to two major mysteries in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this study, we present a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by bundling the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of approximately 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. To validate this concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity comprising six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, achieving results in good agreement with numerical simulations.",
