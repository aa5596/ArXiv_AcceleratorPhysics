  "title": "Above and beyond the laser induced anti Stokes broadband white light   emission in rare earth manganese perovskites",
  "abstract": "Herein, an experimental and theoretical analysis of broadband laser-induced white light emission (LIWE) in lead-free perovskite under near-infrared excitation is reported. LIWE is a tunable emission influenced by excitation wavelength, power density, pressure, and temperature. The radiance profile presented in this work closely resembles the solar spectral distribution, suggesting potential for solid-state lighting and photovoltaic applications. Based on theoretical modelling, along with photophysical and photoconductivity characterisations, a mathematical description of the LIWE generation is presented. This model describes LIWE as a dynamical process that explains the supralinear dependence of the integrated emission intensity on laser power density, pressure, photophysical kinetics, and photocurrent associated with the emission phenomena under excitation at high laser power densities.",
