  "title": "Energy Confinement Time Scaling Law Derived from Paz-Soldan NF 2024",
  "abstract": "Results from C. Paz-Soldan et al 2024 Nucl. Fusion 64 094002 demonstrate encouraging energy confinement properties for the negative triangularity scenario, similar to or exceeding the scaling of the IPB98(y,2) law. This work describes the procedure with which a new scaling law was regressed specifically from the data from the aforementioned article. Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, kernel density estimation was employed to minimize sampling bias and bootstrapping was used to give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.",
