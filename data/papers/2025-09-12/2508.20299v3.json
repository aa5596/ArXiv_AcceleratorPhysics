  "title": "Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas",
  "abstract": "A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.",
