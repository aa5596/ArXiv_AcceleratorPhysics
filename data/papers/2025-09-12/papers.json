    "title": "Phase space compression of a positive muon beam in two spatial   dimensions",
    "abstract": "We present the first demonstration of simultaneous phase space compression in two spatial dimensions of a positive muon beam, the first stage of the novel high-brightness muon beam under development by the muCool collaboration at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The keV-energy, sub-mm size beam would enable a factor 10$^5$ improvement in brightness for precision muSR, and atomic and particle physics measurements with positive muons. This compression is achieved within a cryogenic helium gas target with a strong density gradient, placed in a homogeneous magnetic field, under the influence of a complex electric field. In the next phase, the muon beam will be extracted into vacuum.",

    "title": "Euclid: Methodology for derivation of IPC-corrected conversion gain of   nonlinear CMOS APS",
    "abstract": "We introduce a fast method to measure the conversion gain in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductors (CMOS) Active Pixel Sensors (APS), which accounts for nonlinearity and interpixel capacitance (IPC). The standard 'mean-variance' method is biased because it assumes pixel values depend linearly on signal, and existing methods to correct for nonlinearity are still introducing significant biases. While current IPC correction methods are prohibitively slow for a per-pixel application, our new method uses separate measurements of the IPC kernel to make an almost instantaneous calculation of gain. Validated using test data from a flight detector from the ESA Euclid mission, the IPC correction recovers the results of slower methods within 0.1% accuracy. Meanwhile the nonlinearity correction ensures an estimation of the gain that is independent of signal, correcting a bias of more than 2.5% on gain estimation.",

It includes the theory of the formation of the macroscale spatially inhomogeneous compressed-sheared convective flows by the inhomogeneous microturbulence, the theory of the back reaction of the macroscale convected flows on the microturbulence, and of the slow macroscale responce of a bulk of plasma on the development of the compressed-sheared convective flows.",

    "abstract": "The accurate determination of thermal conductivity $\\kappa(T)$ in bulk materials at room temperature and above is crucial for evaluating their compatibility for specific applications. The 3$\\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films, becoming particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens for $T\\gtrsim$300K, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques, and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. Based on a critical review of the technique's key technical aspects, this work provides practical support for a rapid and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase through to execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.",

LIWE is a tunable emission influenced by excitation wavelength, power density, pressure, and temperature. The radiance profile presented in this work closely resembles the solar spectral distribution, suggesting potential for solid-state lighting and photovoltaic applications. Based on theoretical modelling, along with photophysical and photoconductivity characterisations, a mathematical description of the LIWE generation is presented. This model describes LIWE as a dynamical process that explains the supralinear dependence of the integrated emission intensity on laser power density, pressure, photophysical kinetics, and photocurrent associated with the emission phenomena under excitation at high laser power densities.",

    "title": "Eliminating Tokamak Disruptions with Feedback",
    "abstract": "Many disruptions are caused by resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM). A database of DIII-D locked mode disruptions provides two main disruption criteria, which are shown to be signatures of RWTMs. The first is that the q = 2 rational surface must be sufficiently close the resistive wall surrounding the plasma to interact with it. If active feedback is used, this implies that RWTMs can be prevented from causing major disruptions. This is demonstrated in simulations. The second criterion is that the current profile is sufficiently peaked. This is caused by edge cooling, such as by impurity radiation and turbulence, which suppress edge current and temperature. This implies the disruptions are not caused by neoclassical tearing modes (NTM), because the bootstrap current is also suppressed. The dependence of the critical internal inductance on elongation is given, which suggests that elongation might be used as an actuator to prevent disruptions. At high $\\beta,$ resistive wall modes (RWM) can be stabilized with feedback. Feedback also stabilizes high $\\beta$ RWTMs, as shown in NSTX data and in simulations. These results suggest that RWTM disruptions in ITER might be prevented using the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) coils.",

    "title": "Enhanced water Cherenkov detector for soil moisture detection",
    "abstract": "This work evaluates the ability of a water Cherenkov detector to measure thermal neutrons and explores its application to soil-moisture monitoring. We study a NaCl-doped detector and model its response to (i) monochromatic thermal neutrons and (ii) the natural thermal-neutron flux expected from dry soil at the elevation of Bucaramanga, Colombia. The ambient flux is estimated with the ARTI framework, and the detector response is simulated with MEIGA in Geant4. Doping with NaCl introduces additional capture channels on $^{35,37}\\mathrm{Cl}$ and $^{23}\\mathrm{Na}$; in particular, $^{35}\\mathrm{Cl}$ has a thermal-neutron absorption cross section up to two orders of magnitude larger than hydrogen, boosting the capture signal. Our results indicate that water Cherenkov detectors can detect thermal neutrons with practical sensitivity under field conditions, enabling their integration into precision agriculture networks for soil moisture sensing. More broadly, this approach extends the cosmic-ray detection range of Cherenkov detectors using non-toxic, low-cost materials.",

    "title": "Optimal Landau-type closure parameters for two-fluid simulations of   plasma turbulence at kinetic scales",
    "abstract": "Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.",

    "title": "Restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration through low rank tensor   approximations",
    "abstract": "The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov-Poisson equation. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the numerical flow iteration after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using the blackbox approximation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure numerical flow iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the numerical flow iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the motion of charged particles subjected to a discrete spectrum of electrostatic waves. We focus on situations when transport dominates, leading to significant variations in particle velocity. Nonetheless, these velocity changes remain finite due to the presence of KAM tori bounding phase space. We analyze the conditions under which transport can be modeled as a diffusion process and evaluate the relevance of the so-called quasilinear value of the diffusion coefficient. We distinguish between traditional quasilinear diffusion, when wave-particle interaction is perturbative, and the so-called chaotic regime of diffusion, when the particle motion looks erratic. In the perturbative regime, we demonstrate both numerically and theoretically that diffusion occurs only when wave-particle interaction is local in phase velocity; that is, when wave contributions from phase velocities far from the particles instantaneous velocities are negligible. Conversely, numerical results indicate that chaotic diffusion can occur even when wave-particle interaction is not local. Furthermore, in regimes when quasilinear diffusion is applicable, we introduce a simple analytical expression for the time evolution of the velocity distribution function, that accounts for phase space boundaries.",

    "title": "Cepstral Strain Mapping for Small Pixel-Count Detectors",
    "abstract": "With the decreasing sizes of integrated-circuit components, the semiconductor industry is in growing need of high-throughput strain mapping techniques that offer high precision and spatial resolution, with desired industry goals of 0.01-0.1% and 1 nm respectively. As the fundamental limitation on the measurement precision is set by the Poisson noise, pixel array detectors with high saturation current, high dynamic range and fast readout are ideally suited for this purpose. However, due to the limited pixel count on these detectors, they do not work well with traditional strain mapping algorithms that were optimized to work on datasets with a large pixel count. Here, we evaluate the cepstral transform that was designed to address this problem, with the precision determined by the convergence, collection angles and dose while remaining insensitive to the pixel count. We test the performance of our method on silicon wedges and Si-SiGe multilayers, and using datasets collected at different conditions, we show how the measured strain precision scales as a function of dose, aperture size and sample thickness. Using precession gives a further improvement in precision by about 1.5-2x, whereas energy filtering does not have a significant impact on the cepstral method for device-relevant sample thickness ranges.",

    "title": "An Innovative Photon-Driven Subcritical Reactor Concept Powered by   Synchrotron Radiation Source",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces the conceptual design of a Photon Driven Reactor (PDR), an innovative subcritical reactor designed for energy generation driven by a synchrotron radiation. The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges of conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's structural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron photons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear reactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source simulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust evaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication mechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's capability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the thermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid. Furthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor core loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and environmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able to exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam lines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent subcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \\times 10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each individual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring about 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.",

We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.",

    "abstract": "The edge turbulence model Hermes (Dudson et al., 2017 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 59 05401) is set up for plasma boundary simulations with an RF antenna, using parameters characteristic of a tokamak edge. Cartesian slab geometry is used with thin plate limiters representing the ICRF antenna side-wall limiters. Ad-hoc DC electric biasing of the limiters, motivated by calculations with VSim (Nieter et al., J. Comput. Phys. 196, 448 (2004)), represents an induced RF sheath rectified potential in the plasma turbulence model. Flux-driven turbulence simulations demonstrate a realistic distribution of plasma profiles and fluctuations. There is a clear effect of the antenna sheath voltage leading to formation of convective cells; bias-induced convective transport flattens the SOL density profile and fluctuations penetrate into the shadow region of the limiters as the bias voltage increases. Turbulent transport for impurity ions is inferred by following ion trajectories in the simulated plasma turbulence fields, showing Bohm-like effective diffusion rates. All in all, the model elucidates the key physical phenomena governing the effects of ICRF-induced antenna biasing on the tokamak boundary plasma.",

    "abstract": "Progress in optical techniques has made precision control of the phase profile in optical pulses common and accessible in scientific laboratories. Carefully shaping the field profile of a laser pulse can be used to master the dynamics of electrons traveling in photonic accelerating structures such as the ones obtained by precisely aligning two dielectric gratings. Here we show that by applying a liquid-crystal-mask to program the phase and amplitude of an infrared laser pulse in combination with a pulse front tilt scheme, it is possible to implement dynamic control on a laser accelerator. This results in a nearly limitless live tuning capability of the accelerator beam dynamics, allowing the demonstration software-based correction of structure and optical front imperfections, implementation of transverse focusing schemes, control of the energy and charge of the output beam, and ultimately optimization of the interaction length, leading to measured energy gains of up to 0.55 MeV.",

    "title": "Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants",
    "abstract": "Tokamaks differ fundamentally from stellarators in the importance of the external coils in determining the magnetic field structure. Tokamak plasmas are in a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating dominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields produced by the coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are not easily controlled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full stability range produces only a small change, $\\sim 16\\%$, in the poloidal flux produced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why disruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though difficult seems to be required, especially during shutdown. The rapid temporal decay of $n\\tau_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for the careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications of Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The context of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications of the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, should be helpful in the design of tokamak power plants. (2) Thoughtful allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts is needed to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",

    "abstract": "The spatial resolution of the Micromegas prototype developed for the BabyIAXO experiment was evaluated using a low-energy X-ray beam at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. BabyIAXO, currently under construction, aims to search for hypothetical solar axions. A key component of the experiment is a low-background X-ray detector with high efficiency in the 1-10 keV energy range and stringent background rejection capabilities. Achieving a spatial resolution on the order of, or better than, 1 mm is critical for accurately reconstructing signal shapes and positions, and for effectively discriminating between signal and background events. Therefore, a precise characterization of the detector's spatial resolution is essential to validate its suitability for the experiment. This study involved scanning the IAXO-D1 Micromegas detector under various beam energies, positions, and drift field configurations to evaluate their influence on spatial resolution. A resolution of approximately 100 $\\mu$m at 6 keV was achieved, confirming the strong potential of this technology for application in the final BabyIAXO setup.",

    "title": "Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins",
    "abstract": "Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.",

    "title": "Proton-Acoustic Wave Effects on the Relaxation of Proton Transverse   Heating in Magnetized Plasmas",
    "abstract": "Transverse electromagnetic and electrostatic plasma wave modes propagating along a background magnetic field $\\vec{B}_0$ are independent according to linear kinetic theory. However, resonant interactions and energy exchange between waves and particles break this linear decoupling. This work tracks the coupled evolution of Alfv\\'en-cyclotron (ACWs) and Ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) by solving moment-based quasilinear equations for a collisionless plasma of bi-Maxwellian protons and Maxwellian electrons. Unlike earlier quasilinear studies that adopt the cold-electron limit, our formulation retains the full kinetic response of both species, treating the electrons as a thermal reservoir to isolate proton heating. A parameter survey over $0.01\\leq\\beta_{\\parallel p}\\leq10$ and $1\\le T_e/T_p\\le10$ shows that an ambient spectrum of ACWs can drive significant perpendicular proton heating and raise the temperature anisotropy from initially isotropic conditions at low $\\beta_{\\parallel p}\\lesssim0.1$, thereby triggering cyclotron instabilities. The quasilinear evolution self-regulates the ACW, driving the system toward a quasi-stationary state with $\\gamma/\\Omega_p<10^{-1}$ and reduced anisotropy. As $T_e/T_p$ increases, IAWs become less damped and absorb a larger share of the fluctuation energy through Landau resonance, reducing the efficiency of ACW-driven proton heating and thus regulating the instability. For sufficiently large $\\beta_{\\parallel p}$ or $T_e/T_p\\gtrsim5$, ACWs become inefficient drivers of perpendicular heating, leaving IAWs as the dominant dissipation channel. These results explain how modest electrostatic activity in low-$\\beta$ environments such as the inner heliosphere and planetary magnetosheaths can regulate, but not indefinitely sustain, cyclotron instabilities.",

    "title": "Geometrical optics in phase space",
    "abstract": "Geometrical optics (GO) is widely used for reduced modeling of waves in plasmas but fails near reflection points, where it predicts a spurious singularity of the wave amplitude. We show how to avoid this singularity by adopting a different representation of the wave equation. Instead of the physical space $x$ and the wavevector $k$, we use the ray time $\\tau$ as the new canonical coordinate and the ray energy $h$ as the associated canonical momentum. To derive the envelope equation in the $\\tau$-representation, we construct the Weyl symbol calculus on the $(\\tau, h)$ space and show that the corresponding Weyl symbols are related to their $(x, k)$ counterparts by the Airy transform. This allows us to express the coefficients in the envelope equation through the known properties of the original dispersion operator. When necessary, solutions of this equation can be mapped to the $x$-space using a generalised metaplectic transform. But the field per se might not even be needed in practice. Instead, knowing the corresponding Wigner function usually suffices for linear and quasilinear calculations. As a Weyl symbol itself, the Wigner function can be mapped analytically, using the aforementioned Airy transform. We show that the standard Airy patterns that form in regions where conventional GO fails are successfully reproduced within MGO simply by remapping the field from the $\\tau$-space to the $x$-space. An extension to mode-converting waves is also presented. This formulation, which we call generalised metaplectic GO (MGO) offers a promising tool, for example, for reduced modeling of the O--X conversion in inhomogeneous plasma near the critical density, an effect that is important for fusion applications and also occurs in the ionosphere. Aside from better handling reflection, MGO is similar to GO and can replace it for any practical purposes.",

    "abstract": "We perform extensive 2D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) electromagnetic simulations of low pressure Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges with various coil current and driving frequencies. Our simulations show that in low-frequency cases, electrons in the skin region near the coil can be predominantly magnetized by the Radio Frequency (RF) magnetic field. More specifically, the electrons are trapped in the combined potential well formed by the vector and electrostatic potentials, where they oscillate for most of the RF period while drifting perpendicular to the RF magnetic field. When the magnetic field weakens, electrons shortly demagnetize, leading to jet-like currents and periodic bursts of energy deposition. Based on the newly discovered electron trajectories, we develop a new kinetic theory for the plasma skin effect in low-frequency Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) discharges, incorporating nonlinear electron motion in an RF magnetic field by integrating Vlasov equation along the unperturbed particle trajectory. This theory successfully predicts the time evolution of electron currents in low-frequency ICP plasmas, as well as a nonlinear relation between electron current and the RF inductive electric field in the new regime we found. Furthermore, by coupling this new kinetic theory with a global model, we provide a straightforward method for estimating equilibrium electron temperature, plasma density and electron current. These analytical predictions match well with our 2D PIC simulations and can be validated through future experimental studies.",

Our model incorporates an extensive chemical reaction network to simulate the neutral-neutral and ion-neutral reactions occurring in the COSmIC experiments when using N2-CH4-based gas mixtures relevant to Titan's atmosphere. Our reaction network now includes crucial reactions involving the first electronically-excited state of atomic nitrogen, recent electron collision cross-sections, and radical chemistry. In particular, we have investigated the influence of C2H2 on the gas phase polymeric growth and the elemental composition of the chemical products, and we have compared our findings to recently published solid phase analyses. The modeling results are consistent with experimental measurements of N2-CH4-C2H2 plasmas on COSmIC, showing the production of C6Hx intermediates and precursors of larger organics, as well as methanimine in small concentration. Our numerical results point to cationic pathways enabling efficient intermediate-sized and nitrogen-rich \\ce{C2H2}-driven chemistry driving tholin production. Comparison of the modeled gas phase elemental composition with elemental composition of the solid phase samples produced in COSmIC reveal similar trends, with C/N increasing when C2H2 is present in the gas mixture. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of such synergistic studies using low-temperature plasma chemistry experiments combined with modeling efforts to improve our understanding of cold planetary environments.",

To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.",

    "title": "Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar   UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations",
    "abstract": "A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.",

    "title": "Unifying Kappa Distribution Models for Non-Equilibrium Space Plasmas: A   Superstatistical Approach Based on Moments",
    "abstract": "From the perspective of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, modeling the velocity distribution of particles in non-equilibrium, steady-state plasmas presents a significant challenge. Under this context, a family of kappa distributions has been widely used to capture the high-energy tails in space plasmas. These distributions deviate from the canonical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and vary significantly in their interpretation of the temperature of an out-of-equilibrium system. In this letter, we establish the validity of any kappa distribution from the standpoint of superstatistics. This study unifies these models by introducing a new kappa distribution based on superstatistical parameters, providing a more general and fundamental framework to connect these distributions and the superstatistical temperature of a system. We demonstrate that the general distribution depends on the thermal characteristics of the modeled temperature distribution population. Furthermore, we present a moment-based velocity distribution that bypasses the traditional temperature debate, relying on the velocity moments. Our findings enhance the understanding of kappa distributions and offer a robust model for non-equilibrium space plasmas.",

A mono-energetic beam of chromium ions with initial energies of $\\sim 450$ MeV was fired through a magnetized interaction region formed by the collision of two counter-propagating laser-ablated plasma jets. While laser interferometry revealed the absence of strong fluid-scale turbulence, acceleration and diffusion of the beam ions was driven by wave-particle interactions.

    "title": "Performance envelope of laser wakefield accelerators",
    "abstract": "Laser wakefield accelerator experiments have made enormous progress over the past $\\sim 20$ years, but their promise to revolutionize high-energy particle sources is only beginning to be realized. To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from $>50$ published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 \\si{\\micro\\meter}, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a $\\gtrsim 30$ PW laser operating at electron density $<10^{17}/$cm$^3$.",

    "abstract": "The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.",

    "title": "A Generalisable Generative Model for Multi-Detector Calorimeter   Simulation",
    "abstract": "Collider experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider, use the Geant4 toolkit to simulate particle-detector interactions with high accuracy. However, these experiments increasingly require larger amounts of simulated data, leading to huge computing cost. Generative machine learning methods could offer much faster calorimeter shower simulations by directly emulating detector responses. In this work, we present CaloDiT-2, a diffusion model which uses transformer blocks. As is the case for other models explored for this task, it can be applied to specific geometries, however its true strength lies in its generalisation capabilities. Our approach allows pre-training on multiple detectors and rapid adaptation to new ones, which we demonstrate on the LEMURS dataset. It reduces the effort required to develop accurate models for novel detectors or detectors which are under development and have geometries that are changed frequently, requiring up to 25x less data and 20x less training time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pre-trained model to be published that allows adaptation in the context of particle shower simulations, with the model also included in the Geant4 toolkit. We also present results on benchmarks on Dataset-2 from the community-hosted CaloChallenge, showing that our models provide one of the best tradeoffs between accuracy and speed from the published models. Our contributions include a mechanism for the creation of detector-agnostic data representations, architectural modifications suitable for the data modality, a pre-training and adaptation strategy, and publicly released datasets and pre-trained models for broad use.",

Resonance lines originate from non linear elements and effects in the lattice, imposing strict constraints on the choice of working points and narrowing the available tune space. Circular modes are round coupled beams with non zero angular momentum, provide an alternative beam motion and dynamics. In this study, we derive the third-order sextupole resonance conditions in the coupled (normal-mode) parametrization and show that, with circular-mode lattice design and beam operation, most of these resonance lines are naturally suppresses due to the inherent flatness of the mode.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of large cryogenic detector arrays, comprising hundreds to thousands of individual detectors, is highly beneficial for various cutting-edge applications, requiring large statistics, angular resolution or imaging capabilities. The readout of such arrays, however, presents a major challenge in terms of system complexity, parasitic heat load, and cost, which can be overcome only through multiplexing. Among the various multiplexing approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work, we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout. Our results confirm that our system is fully functional and provides a scalable path towards future large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.",

We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.",

Additive-free electroformed copper offers exceptional radiopurity, but is limited in mechanical strength, motivating the exploration of application-specific copper-based alloys. Early investigations, based on direct experimentation, explored the synthesis of CuCr alloys through electrodeposition and thermal processing. Subsequently, modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the alloy compositions were employed, which led to specific proposals for improved thermal processing. Moreover, the systematic application of computational thermodynamics to materials design further motivated the investigation of CuCrTi alloys, in addition to CuCr alloys. This materials design approach has shaped a trajectory towards designing high-performance, radiopure copper-based alloys, minimizing lengthy and costly trial-and-error.

    "abstract": "Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.",

    "title": "AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and   FPGA Feasibility",
    "abstract": "Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers remains a long-standing challenge, particularly in environments dominated by strong and variable radio-frequency interference. Current radio arrays usually rely on external particle-detector triggers: while this lowers thresholds for vertical showers, it excludes very inclined events, where radio detection is uniquely powerful because the particle cascade is absorbed while the radio pulse remains measurable. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study showing that deep-learning-based triggering can overcome these limitations, operating robustly under realistic high-interference conditions and within the strict latency constraints of large-scale observatories. Using measured noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network was trained and optimised for MHz-scale trigger-trial rates, and its performance was compared to a simple threshold-based trigger, which proved markedly less efficient at the same false-positive rate. The trained model was then quantised with HLS4ML and synthesised with Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference latencies.These results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, particularly in regions with strong and variable radio backgrounds. This capability unlocks access to weak and highly inclined air-shower signals--even in noisy environments--thereby broadening the energy range, extending sky coverage, and opening the path toward ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with ground-based radio arrays.",

    "title": "The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays   (IMPISH): a spectrometer for the GRIPS-2 balloon campaign",
    "abstract": "The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon. IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.   The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel method for reconstructing excitation energy and center-of-mass scattering angle from energy-position data in solenoidal spectrometers, addressing challenges posed by non-linearities at small scattering angles. The approach employs a robust calibration of experimental energy-position data using known excited states, followed by an analytical inverse transformation based on relativistic kinematics and cyclotron motion. Integrated into the HELIOS online analysis routines, this method enables real-time generation of excitation energy spectra and angular distributions during experiments, improving efficiency and accuracy over traditional projection-based methods. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated using the 25Mg(d,p) reaction, highlighting its ability to handle forward-angle data and produce precise kinematic reconstructions.",

    "title": "Imaging and Radio Signatures of Shock-Plasmoid Interaction",
    "abstract": "Understanding how shocks interact with coronal structures is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Using simultaneous radio and white-light observations, we investigate the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a plasmoid. LASCO and STEREO-A COR-2 white-light images are analyzed to track the evolution of the plasmoid, CME and its associated shock, while the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES dynamic spectra provide complementary radio signatures of the shock-plasmoid interaction at $\\approx$7 R$_\\odot$. An interplanetary Type II radio burst was detected as the shock propagated through the plasmoid. The merging of the plasmoid into the CME was accompanied by interplanetary Type III radio bursts, suggesting escaping electron beams during the reconnection process. These observations clearly demonstrate that shock-plasmoid interactions can enhance the efficiency of particle acceleration associated with CMEs, with implications for electron acceleration in flare and heliospheric current sheets as well.",

    "title": "Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical   Models",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.",

Material screening and background controls were implemented to meet stringent radio-purity targets, while extensive testing was employed to select science-grade CCDs for the modules and confirm their excellent performance after fabrication.

    "title": "Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas",
    "abstract": "A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.",

Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, kernel density estimation was employed to minimize sampling bias and bootstrapping was used to give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.",
