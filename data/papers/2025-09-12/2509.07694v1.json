  "title": "Avoiding Beam Instabilities and Resonances With Circular Modes",
  "abstract": "Beam instabilities and resonances affect the transverse dynamics in particle accelerators and, when encountered, can trigger emittance growth and beam loss. Resonance lines originate from non linear elements and effects in the lattice, imposing strict constraints on the choice of working points and narrowing the available tune space. Circular modes are round coupled beams with non zero angular momentum, provide an alternative beam motion and dynamics. In this study, we derive the third-order sextupole resonance conditions in the coupled (normal-mode) parametrization and show that, with circular-mode lattice design and beam operation, most of these resonance lines are naturally suppresses due to the inherent flatness of the mode.",
