  "title": "To the theoretical description of the losses in inductance coils",
  "abstract": "The article discusses a theory that allows to describe losses in conductors taking into account the skin effect and the proximity effect. The developed theory is applied to inductance coils. In contrast to the classical Butterworth theory the condition of the strong skin effect, which is frequent in practice, is introduced from the very beginning. This approach makes possible to obtain extremely simple formulas, which show that Q-factor of a coil is determined mainly by the diameter of its winding.",
