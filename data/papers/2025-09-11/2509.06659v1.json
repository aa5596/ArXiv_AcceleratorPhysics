  "title": "Optically interrogated liquid crystal-based, charge-mode accelerometer   telemetry",
  "abstract": "A hybrid optoelectronic vibration sensing system is presented, combining a conventional charge-mode piezoelectric accelerometer with an optical fiber interface via a liquid crystal-based electrical-to-optical transducer. This configuration allows the accelerometer's electrical output to be converted into an optical signal, enabling remote signal transmission over optical fiber. The same fiber could also be used to supply power to the system, offering a compact and interference-resistant solution suitable for challenging environments such as those with high voltages or explosive risks. Experimental results demonstrate a displacement resolution ranging from \\Delta z = 0.015 nm at 0.160 nm displacement, up to \\Delta z = 0.720 nm at 351 nm displacement, or equivalently, from \\alpha = 0.0005 m/s2 to 0.057 m/s2 in acceleration. Despite undergoing electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical signal conversion, the system maintains high sensitivity, low noise levels, and signal integrity. This proof-of-concept optically interrogated accelerometer highlights a path toward reducing sensor infrastructure requirements by eliminating the need for conventional power supplies and electromagnetic shielding, which are typically required in fully electrical accelerometer systems.",
