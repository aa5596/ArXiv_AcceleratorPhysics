  "title": "Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through   Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail",
  "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.",
