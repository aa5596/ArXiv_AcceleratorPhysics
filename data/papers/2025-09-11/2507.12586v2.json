  "title": "Extended thermal cycling of ATLAS ITk strip modules with and without   stress mitigating interposers",
  "abstract": "This paper investigates critical mechanical failures during stand-alone thermocycling of ATLAS Inner Tracker strip pre-production modules. Five modules undergo extended thermocycling after adequately levelling thermal chucks and introducing interlocks for unattended operation. Module bow evolution is tracked via regular sensor metrology. All five modules exhibit bow increases with a mean of $146\\pm 27~\\mu$m when raising maximum cycling temperatures from $20^\\circ$C to $40^\\circ$C. Four such modules exhibit sensor fractures when cycled to $-44^\\circ$C. A stress-mitigating layer of silicone gel and Kapton film interposer is introduced to three further modules, with detailed quality control data establishing electromechanical viability. No significant bow change of $1\\pm 10~\\mu$m is observed after ten cycles between $[+40, -44]^\\circ$C relative to $[+20, -44]^\\circ$C. Two interposer modules undergo 200 thermocycles up to $[+56, -44]^\\circ$C without fracturing. This decreased sensor deformation and fracturing is interpreted as evidence for reduced thermal stress.",
