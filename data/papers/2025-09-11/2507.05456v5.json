  "title": "Constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants",
  "abstract": "Tokamaks differ fundamentally from stellarators in the importance of the external coils in determining the magnetic field structure. Tokamak plasmas are in a self-organized state, especially when fusion rather than external heating dominates. Stellarator optimization focuses on the magnetic fields produced by the coils. Tokamak optimization considers plasma profiles, which are not easily controlled. A deviation of the profile of the plasma current over its full stability range produces only a small change, $\\sim 16\\%$, in the poloidal flux produced by the plasma current. This offers a simple explanation of why disruptions in tokamaks are so common, and why current-profile control though difficult seems to be required, especially during shutdown. The rapid temporal decay of $n\\tau_ET$ in high performance tokamak experiments shows the need for the careful control for other profiles. Here the focus is on the implications of Faraday's Law since important but new implications are easily derived. The context of the paper is twofold: (1) Simplified statements of the implications of the laws of physics, in particular Faraday's Law, should be helpful in the design of tokamak power plants. (2) Thoughtful allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts is needed to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",
