  "title": "Time-Embedded Convolutional Neural Networks for Modeling Plasma Heat   Transport",
  "abstract": "We introduce a time-embedded convolutional neural network (TCNN) for modeling spatiotemporal heat transport in plasmas, particularly under strongly nonlocal conditions. In our earlier work, the LMV-Informed Neural Network (LINN) (Luo et al., arXiv:2506.16619) combined prior knowledge from the LMV model with kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) data to improve kernel-based heat-flux predictions. While effective under moderately nonlocal conditions, LINN produced physically inconsistent kernels in strongly time-dependent regimes due to its reliance on the quasi-stationary LMV formulation. To overcome this limitation, TCNN is designed to capture the coupled evolution of both the normalized heat flux and the characteristic nonlocality parameter using a unified neural architecture informed by underlying physical principles. Trained on fully kinetic PIC simulations, TCNN accurately reproduces nonlocal dynamics across a broad range of collisionalities. Our results demonstrate that the combination of time modulation, coupled prediction, and convolutional depth significantly enhances predictive performance, offering a data-driven yet physically consistent framework for multiscale plasma transport problems.",
