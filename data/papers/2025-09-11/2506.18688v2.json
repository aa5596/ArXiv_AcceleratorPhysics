  "title": "Prism-based compensation of group delay dispersion in the components of   a femtosecond laser resonator and analysis of the influence of prism   configuration on laser radiation parameters",
  "abstract": "A mathematical algorithm is described for calculating the minimum distance between prisms and the allowable prism insertion depth into the laser beam when solving the general problem of intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation. GDD is caused by the optical elements of the master oscillator in a femtosecond laser system. The calculation was carried out using analytical and geometrical methods. The influence of changing the distance between the prisms and the depth of their insertion into the laser beam on the GDD compensation has been investigated. Under experimental conditions, this changes the Q-factor of the laser resonator, which determines the central wavelength of the radiation and its spectral width in a titanium-sapphire laser.",
