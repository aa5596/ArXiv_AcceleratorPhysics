  "title": "Express Diagnostic of Intense Laser-driven MeV Radiation Source using   Copper Isotopes",
  "abstract": "We explored the generation and diagnosis of high-brightness MeV bremsstrahlung radiation caused by intense beam of relativistic electrons propagating in a tantalum converter. The intense electron beam was produced through direct laser acceleration mechanism in the interaction of relativistic high-power sub-ps laser pulse with near critical density plasma. We propose to detect the divergence angle and photon fluence of high-brightness and high-energy gamma radiation source based on the nuclear activation method. The radioactive 62^Cu was generated through photonuclear reactions 63^Cu(gamma,n) 62^Cu and the subsequent beta^+ decay of 62^Cu was measured to derive characteristics of the gamma radiation source. This method provides an express approach to diagnose the laser-driven MeV radiation source and a potential efficient way to produce 62^Cu isotopes.",
