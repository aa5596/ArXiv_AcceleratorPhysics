  "title": "Design of high-strength, radiopure, electroformed copper-based alloys   for rare-event searches: Impact of layer configuration on heat treatments",
  "abstract": "State-of-the-art and next-generation rare-event search experiments rely on detector materials with stringent requirements on radiopurity and mechanical performance. Additive-free electroformed copper offers exceptional radiopurity, but is limited in mechanical strength, motivating the exploration of application-specific copper-based alloys. Early investigations, based on direct experimentation, explored the synthesis of CuCr alloys through electrodeposition and thermal processing. Subsequently, modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the alloy compositions were employed, which led to specific proposals for improved thermal processing. Moreover, the systematic application of computational thermodynamics to materials design further motivated the investigation of CuCrTi alloys, in addition to CuCr alloys. This materials design approach has shaped a trajectory towards designing high-performance, radiopure copper-based alloys, minimizing lengthy and costly trial-and-error. In this work, we explore the impact of initial layer configuration on the effectiveness of heat treatments, paving the way toward manufacturable, radiopure, multicomponent alloys for future low-background experiments.",
