  "title": "Study of a coaxial vacuum arc thruster plume and its interaction with   applied magnetic field",
  "abstract": "A hybrid model where ions are treated as particles and electrons with fluid equations for magnetized electron flux is adapted in order to simulate a vacuum arc source. This source is a candidate for solid propellant propulsion system of micro- and nano-satellites. We show preliminary results of the plume and interelectrode region properties with and without the influence of an imposed magnetic field. We compare the results with experimental data, and we find that the magnetic collimation is overestimated in the simulation",
