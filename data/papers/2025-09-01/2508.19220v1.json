  "title": "The 2025 Roadmaps for the US Magnet Development Program",
  "abstract": "The US Physics community completed the Snowmass planning process in 2022, culminating in the HEPAP Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) publishing its summary report at the end of 2023. Building on this, the US Magnet Development Program, a national accelerator magnet R&D program established by DOE-OHEP in 2016, has updated its strategic plan to align with the 2023 P5 report, resulting in this roadmap document.",
