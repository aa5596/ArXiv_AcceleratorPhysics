  "title": "Further Characterization of the JadePix-3 CMOS Pixel Sensor for the CEPC   Vertex Detector",
  "abstract": "The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation $e^+e^-$ collider to enable high-precision studies of the Higgs boson and potential new physics, imposes rigorous demands on detector technologies, particularly the vertex detector. JadePix-3 is a prototype Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) designed for the CEPC vertex detector. This paper presents a detailed laboratory-based characterization of the JadePix-3 sensor, focusing on the previously under-explored effects of substrate reverse bias voltage on key performance metrics: charge collection efficiency, average cluster size, and detection efficiency. Systematic testing demonstrated that JadePix-3 operates reliably under reverse bias, exhibiting a reduced input capacitance, an expanded depletion region, enhanced charge collection efficiency, and a lower fake-hit rate. These findings confirm the sensor's potential for high-precision particle tracking and vertexing at the CEPC while offering valuable references for future iterational R\\&D of the JadePix series.",
