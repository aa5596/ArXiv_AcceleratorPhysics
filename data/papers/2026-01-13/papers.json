    "title": "Self-organization of local streamline structures and energy transfer rate in compressible plasma turbulence",
    "abstract": "We examine how local streamline topology and energy cascade rate self-organize in plasma turbulence for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\\nabla\\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).",

    "abstract": "The article Nuclear Fusion \\textbf{66}, 016012 (2026) by Richard Fitzpatrick is based on fundamental errors in the physics of the poloidal magnetic flux in tokamaks. His paper was inspired by an article that I posted on arXiv in various versions [arXiv:2507.05456]. The September 9, 2025 version was submitted to the Physics of Plasmas, which flatly rejected the article. Before I can resubmit, the Physics of Plasmas stated that the issues with the Fitzpatrick article must be explained. Not only did Fitzpatrick make numerous fundamental errors in science, he totally misrepresented my views as clearly stated in my article and even more explicitly in email exchanges, called ``private communication\" in his paper. Enquiries were made to the journal Nuclear Fusion staring on November 24, 2025 of the consistency of Fitzpatrick's article with the scientific and ethical standards of the journal. On January 5, 2026, Nuclear Fusion said they had \"no evidence of intentional misrepresentation,\" but others may disagree after reading the emails. Both grants and the publication of an important paper make the public availability of this Comment urgent.",

A variety of photon counting and charge integrating detectors and sCMOS cameras have been integrated into a common data acquisition (DAQ) system in which data are streamed to a central Kubernetes cluster, mounting an IBM Storage Scale (GPFS) file system. The DAQ system provides live feedback from the detectors/cameras and extends to enable on-the-fly data processing. Control system integration via Tango provides a standardised single interface for controlling all DAQ components.

    "title": "Dynamics of ion temperature gradient modes in burning plasma conditions in the presence of energetic particles",
    "abstract": "The interaction between energetic particles (EPs) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes is studied using the global particle in cell ORB5 code. In this work, we extend previous studies to a broader range of EP temperatures, including the burning plasma regime and to wider variety of EP distribution functions. Two main stabilization mechanisms are found to be effective in ITG stabilization confirming previous studies: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective only at intermediate EP temperatures and dilution effect (DE) which is independent of EP temperature and becomes dominant in burning plasma regime ($T_f > 50T_i$). The study is further extended to slowing-down EP distributions which in contrast exhibit no DDRM-related stabilization. The findings are further validated in an ITER pre-fusion operation scenario and additionally compared with electromagnetic effects. In this scenario EP stabilization is found to be weaker than $β$-stabilization. Overall, these results provide better understanding of EP-ITG interactions over a wider range of EP parameters relevant to burning plasma regime which is important for predicting turbulence and confinement in future devices such as ITER.",

    "title": "Toward Quantitative Electric-Field Measurements of Inception Clouds in Nanosecond Discharges Using E-FISH Assisted by Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution of the electric field during the early stages of a nanosecond positive corona discharge in atmospheric-pressure air by combining time-resolved E-FISH measurements, machine-learning-assisted field inversion (based on a recently developed operator-learning model), and iCCD optical emission imaging. The objective is to quantitatively characterize the electric field in the vicinity of the high-voltage electrode during inception and the transition toward streamer formation. By averaging over a large number of discharge events and operating in a regime where the discharge remains statistically axisymmetric, the proposed approach enables reconstruction of the electric-field profiles with nanosecond resolution. The results show a rapid increase of the field during the first nanoseconds, followed by the formation of a shell-like structure exhibiting the highest reduced fields prior to destabilization. The reconstructed reduced electric-field magnitude reaches peak values in the range of approximately 230-270 Td, with an estimated uncertainty of about 20-30% associated with calibration and profile-shape effects. These values correspond to the regime where electron-impact excitation and photoionization processes become highly efficient, consistent with the observed transition from a stable inception cloud to streamer destabilization. After the onset of streamer branching, increasing asymmetry limits the applicability of the inversion, and the reconstructed fields represent averaged contributions rather than the local field at individual streamer heads. The methodology thus identifies the conditions under which quantitative E-field mapping is reliable and establishes a framework for extending electric-field diagnostics to the inception phase of nanosecond atmospheric discharges.",

    "title": "Stray Field NMR: a powerful method to measure dynamics at the millisecond scale",
    "abstract": "Transport properties in fluids and confined systems play a central role across a wide range of natural and technological contexts, from geology and environmental sciences to biology, energy storage, and membrane-based separation processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using \"NMR-exotic\" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes.",

    "title": "Energy Bounds from Relative Magnetic Helicity in Spherical Shells",
    "abstract": "Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.",

Compared to the non-relativistic counterpart, an additional source term for canonical vorticity is identified, which embodies the misalignment between the fluid momentum and fluid velocity gradients. This kineclinic term breaks the frozen-in condition of canonical vorticity, thereby enabling generation or dissipation of magnetic fields and vorticity. We verify the role of this effect through particle-in-cell simulations of a modified Beltrami flow. Kineclinicity should be finite for all relativistic plasma systems due to the general lack of a functional relationship between fluid momentum and fluid velocity.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel application of the Timepix3 optical camera (Tpx3Cam) for investigating ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at the Extreme Light Infrastructure European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ELI ERIC). The camera, integrated into an ion imaging system based on a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a fast P47 scintillator, enables individual time-stamping of incoming ions with nanosecond timing precision and high spatial resolution. The detector successfully captured laser-induced ion events originating from free nanoparticles disintegrated by intense laser pulses. Owing to the broad size distribution of the nanoparticles (10-500 nm) and the variation in laser intensities within the interaction volume, the detected events range in occupancy from near-zero to extremely high, approaching the readout limits of the detector. By combining time-of-flight and velocity map imaging (VMI) techniques, detailed post-processing and analysis were performed. The results presented here focus on the performance of Tpx3Cam under high-occupancy conditions, which are of particular relevance to this study. These conditions approach the limitations imposed by the camera readout capabilities and challenge the effectiveness of standard post-processing algorithms. We investigated these limitations and associated trade-offs, and we present improved methods and algorithms designed to extract the most informative features from the data.",

    "title": "Universal Analytic Solution for the Quantum Transport of Structured Matter-Waves in Magnetic Optics",
    "abstract": "We present a closed-form analytic solution for the propagation of an arbitrary charged scalar state in a non-uniform magnetic field. The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry reveals interference-driven dynamics beyond rigid rotation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a practical tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes.",

    "title": "Energy partitioning in electrostatic discharge with variable series load resistor",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental investigation into the energy partitioning of quasi-static electrostatic discharge (ESD) events in air, a scenario in which the discharge occurs across a gap length that can be considered fixed. We systematically characterize the energy transferred to a series victim load across a broad range of resistances (0.1 to 10,000Ohm) and circuit parameters, including capacitance and gap length. Our results show that the fraction of stored energy delivered to the victim load is largely independent of gap length. We demonstrate that our extension of the classic Rompe-Weizel spark resistance model effectively predicts the scaling of this energy transfer, establishing a clear link between spark resistance and energy partitioning. These findings provide a predictive framework that should be valuable for guiding safety requirements for energetic materials and ignition scenarios and will inform the development of more accurate circuit models that can be applied to a wider range of ESD events such as those found in the electronics industry.",

    "title": "Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation in Laser Plasma",
    "abstract": "Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation (BISER) appears as a bright temporally and spatially coherent Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray source driven by compact multi-terawatt femtosecond lasers in gas targets. There BISER originates from relativistic plasma singularities, so that the emission source size has a nanometer scale. The BISER x-ray yield quadratically depends on the driving laser power. BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds). Based on the BISER brightness at ~20 terawatt laser power and the quadratic scaling, the brightness of BISER driven by petawatt-class lasers is predicted to exceed XUV free electron lasers. The BISER concept creates a new framework for a wide range of media emitting travelling waves capable of constructive interference, including gravitational waves. Here we review the BISER experimental discovery, its explanation based on the relativistic laser plasma simulations and catastrophe theory, experimental validation of the theoretical BISER model, proposal for imaging fast moving singularities, driving laser requirements, and future prospects emphasizing the driving laser wavelength scalability and possibility of terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation.",

    "title": "Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\\infty$ Approach",
    "abstract": "At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.",

    "title": "Enhanced Dark Matter Sensitivity using a Hybrid SiPM-SNSPD-Qubit Detector in Liquid Argon",
    "abstract": "We investigate novel strategies to extend the sensitivity of dark matter direct detection experiments to energy deposits well below the thresholds of conventional detectors. In liquid-argon time-projection chambers equipped with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), we show that improved optical readout, combined with a nuclear dielectric constant (NDC) correction to the WIMP nucleus interaction, enhances the response to low-momentum-transfer nuclear recoils. The NDC effectively amplifies the interaction strength at small recoil energies, increasing the expected ionization and scintillation yields without modifying the high-energy behavior constrained by calibration data. When coupled to SiPM based light collection, this mechanism lowers the effective detection threshold to the subKeV regime, significantly improving sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs and other weakly interacting particles. Complementarily, we present the design and projected performance of a qubit-based detector optimized for ultra-low-energy depositions. A novel two-chip architecture is employed to minimize signal dissipation, while quantum parity measurements enable enhanced single-phonon sensitivity. Full simulations of phonon propagation and quasiparticle dynamics demonstrate that energy deposits at the level of $\\gtrsim 30 meV$ can be detected with nearly unit efficiency and high energy resolution. This capability is expected to advance sensitivity to dark-matter scattering for masses $m_χ\\gtrsim 0.01 MeV$ by several orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and to enable competitive searches for axion and dark-photon absorption in the $0.04 - 0.2 eV$ mass range.",

    "abstract": "The inner tracking system of the ATLAS experiment will be upgraded to a full silicon detector in 2030 for HL-LHC. The new tracking system is called ITk, the Inner Tracker. It is required to be operable with efficiency higher than 99\\% and noise hit occupancy smaller than 0.1\\%. During the pre-production phase of the ITk project, many short-strip modules were observed to exhibit so-called \"Cold Noise (CN)\", wherein clusters of strips displayed very high noise when the modules were operated at temperatures below~$-35\\degree$C. To investigate the CN impact and ensure the quality of module production, huge amount of effort have been put in by the collaboration. This paper focuses on the impact of CN on the tracking performance by examining two short strip modules that exhibit CN: one is non-irradiated, while the other one has been irradiated to the maximum expected end-of-lifetime fluence. For each module, the global and single strip tracking performance are evaluated.",

A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.",

    "title": "Dispersive Properties of MHD Waves in the Expanding Solar Wind for a Parker Spiral Geometry",
    "abstract": "In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $ω(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|δE_\\parallel|/|δB_\\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|δE_\\parallel|/|δB_\\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.",

    "abstract": "Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.   Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).",

    "title": "On the gravitational stratification of multi-fluid-multi-species plasma",
    "abstract": "Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.",

    "title": "Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics",
    "abstract": "Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.   Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.   The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.   The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive multi-species comparison of rotational temperature probes in a DC Ar/N$_2$ micro-hollow cathode discharge",
    "abstract": "Accurate gas temperature ($T_{\\rm Gas}$) determination in microplasmas is critical for optimizing their applications, yet isolated diagnostic approaches may yield misleading results, especially under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Here, high resolution rotational spectra of N$_2$(C), OH(A), NH(A) and NO(A), generated in the plasma jet of a DC Ar/N$_2$ microhollow cathode discharge (MHCD), are recorded and their associated rotational temperatures ($T_{\\rm rot}$) are cross compared. A detailed experimental analysis and robust fitting of the rotational spectra are performed, achieving a reliable estimation of $T_{\\rm Gas}$. The dominant formation mechanisms of these species and their corresponding impact on rotational population distributions are also interrogated. Particularly, our findings indicate that the $T_{\\rm rot}$of N$_2$(C) is significantly influenced by energy transfers from argon metastables (Ar$^m$) and spectral interference from NH(A). This makes it unreliable as a thermometric probe in Ar-rich MHCD, unless complex analyses are employed. In contrast, OH(A) rotational population distribution appears to be less sensitive to Ar-induced perturbations across various discharge currents and pressures, providing more straightforward results. For all molecules considered, this study reveals the conditions under which all the measured $T_{\\rm rot}$ can be reliably considered to be in equilibrium with $T_{\\rm Gas}$. This highlights the importance of crossvalidating multiple thermometric probes and investigating relevant excitation kinetics when measuring $T_{\\rm rot}$ in reactive microplasmas.",

    "title": "Wakefield Acceleration in a Layered Plasma Waveguide",
    "abstract": "Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.",

By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.",

The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.",

    "abstract": "The NEXT collaboration is investigating the double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using high-pressure gas electroluminescent time projection chambers, which provide excellent energy resolution together with a robust topological signature. Operating at the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc (LSC) and building on the success of the NEXT-White detector, the NEXT-100 apparatus began commissioning in May 2024 and started operation with xenon at a pressure of 4 bar in October 2024.   We report here the first results obtained with NEXT-100 using low-energy calibration data from $^{83m}$Kr decays, which allow mapping of the detector response in the active volume and monitoring of its stability over time. After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{ββ}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.",

    "title": "Spatial resolution(s) in atom probe tomography",
    "abstract": "Atom probe tomography (APT) is often quoted to provide \"atomic-scale\" analysis of materials in three dimensions. Despite efforts to quantify APT's spatial resolution, misunderstanding remain regarding its true spatial performance. If the depth resolution was once reported to be 20 pm, quoting this value outside of its specific context is misleading and should be avoided. The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution. Finally, we discuss concepts to improve the spatial accuracy of the technique in a relatively distant future.",

    "title": "Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma",
    "abstract": "Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 μm), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 μm). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.",

    "title": "Detection of MEMS Acoustics via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.",

    "title": "Ultra-sensitive graphene-based electro-optic sensors for optically-multiplexed neural recording",
    "abstract": "Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $μ$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent timing resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine learning has been integrated into the detector design process from the ground up. Detector design objectives are defined using Machine Learning based reconstruction and Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design. The highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for much more expensive detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system and a neutron hadron calorimeter. In EIC kinematics, charged particles are best measured through tracking rather than calorimetry, but the hKLM can identify and measure the momentum of neutral hadrons. The latter are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\\% are achieved using time of flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than that demonstrated for similar calorimeters read out with less granularity.",

    "title": "Properties of Magnetic Switchbacks in the Near-Sun Solar Wind",
    "abstract": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfvénic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

    "title": "Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS",
    "abstract": "High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.",

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$.

    "abstract": "The $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction plays a crucial role in stellar evolution, including the occurrence of supernova explosions, and in the synthesis of the chemical elements. However, our understanding of its cross section remains severely deficient, particularly below $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.5$\\,MeV, the energy range of interest for astrophysics. To address these unresolved issues, the LUNA collaboration will conduct a dedicated study of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction at the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility (Bellotti IBF) located deep underground within the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Based on the combination of passive and active shields, this campaign aims to achieve unprecedented sensitivity in measuring the cross sections of the two key reaction channels, $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$α$)$^{20}$Ne and $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$p$)$^{23}$Na in the low-energy regime via $γ$-ray detection. Here, we report on a sensitivity study for the upcoming campaign with a focus on the characterization of two detectors, namely a HPGe detector and a NaI(Tl) array. Furthermore, their intrinsic contamination is thoroughly investigated since this could potentially influence the overall sensitivity. Assuming typical beam intensities of the Bellotti IBF, we will be able to investigate reaction rates significantly below 100 counts per day. In case of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction we therefore expect to acquire experimental data well below the current limit of $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.1\\,$MeV.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionise the future of scientific simulations. To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.",
