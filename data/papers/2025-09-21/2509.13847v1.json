  "title": "Measurement of radiant spectrum for excess heat generation in NiCu and   Ni thin film during hydrogen gas desorption",
  "abstract": "Heat production in Ni-based thin films interacting with hydrogen gas was studied using a radiation calorimeter equipped with a composite photon-detector system. Measurements were performed on pure Ni foil and NiCu composite thin films. Electromagnetic radiation emitted from samples heated to approximately 1100 K in vacuum was recorded over the energy range of 0.05 - 2.5 eV. In this study,detailed spectra were obtained, particularly in the low-energy region below 0.5 eV. The peak of the thermal radiation spectrum was observed around 0.2 eV, deviating from that expected for simple graybody radiation. Spectral variations depending on the presence or absence of hydrogen differed between the NiCu and pure Ni samples. The total radiated energy was determined directly from the measured radiation power, without relying on radiation models. The excess heat generated in the NiCu sample was estimated to be approximately 1.1 W. A comparable but slightly smaller excess heat generation was also observed in Ni. Long-term measurements of the NiCu sample demonstrated sustained excess heat production for at least 215 hours, with a decay time exceeding 2000 hours.",
