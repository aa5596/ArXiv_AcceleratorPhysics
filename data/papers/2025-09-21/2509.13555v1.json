  "title": "A Computational Picture of Hydride Formation and Dissipation In Nb SRF   Cavities",
  "abstract": "Research linking surface hydrides to Q-disease, and the subsequent development of methods to eliminate surface hydrides, is one of the great successes of SRF cavity R&D. We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can eliminate HFQS.",
