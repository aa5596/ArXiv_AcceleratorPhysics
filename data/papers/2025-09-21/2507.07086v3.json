  "title": "Lifetime study of the ColdADC for the Deep Underground Neutrino   Experiment",
  "abstract": "ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments. ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17 kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.",
