  "title": "Magnetic measurements of Fermilab rapid-cycling Booster gradient magnets",
  "abstract": "Fermilab is upgrading its Booster synchrotron to increase ramp rate and intensity. This is part of the Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) that will allow the Main Injector to achieve proton beam power of 1.2 MW within the next few years. This upgrade includes running the 55-year-old Booster magnets at 20 Hz instead of the usual 15 Hz, and construction of some shorter and wider aperture versions of these combined-function gradient magnets. Magnetic measurements were performed to characterize the present 15 Hz AC performance, and then again with 20 Hz ramp cycle to ensure performance and compatibility in this new operating regime. A 3 m-long curved flat-coil was developed for these measurements using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology. The probe also has a separate 0.5 m-long body-field probe, allowing integral, body, and end fields to be measured across 100 mm of the magnet aperture. The sampling rate for these measurements during the AC cycle was 200 kHz, and field resolution was better than 0.01%. Details of the probe, measurements, and results are presented.",
