  "title": "On How Zonal Fields Suppress Reversed Shear Alfvén Eigenmode in Tokamak Plasmas",
  "abstract": "Employing both nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations and theoretical analyses, we have discovered the novel result that, with energetic particle dynamics kept linear, the nonlinear suppression and eventual saturation of reversed-shear Alfvén eigenmode occur via the downward frequency chirping induced by the beat-driven zonal current. More specifically, as the mode frequency chirps downward, there is enhanced mode conversion to radially propagating electron Landau-damped kinetic Alfvén waves; resulting in enhanced convective (radiative) damping and, thereby, its suppression and saturation. Theoretical results are in good agreement with simulations both qualitatively and quantitatively.",
