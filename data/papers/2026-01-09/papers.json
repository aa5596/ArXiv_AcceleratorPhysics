    "title": "Design and Expected Performance for an hKLM at the EIC",
    "abstract": "We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent timing resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine learning has been integrated into the detector design process from the ground up. Detector design objectives are defined using Machine Learning based reconstruction and Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design. The highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for much more expensive detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system and a neutron hadron calorimeter. In EIC kinematics, charged particles are best measured through tracking rather than calorimetry, but the hKLM can identify and measure the momentum of neutral hadrons. The latter are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\\% are achieved using time of flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than that demonstrated for similar calorimeters read out with less granularity.",

    "title": "Properties of Magnetic Switchbacks in the Near-Sun Solar Wind",
    "abstract": "Magnetic switchbacks are fluctuations in the solar wind in which the interplanetary magnetic field sharply deflects away from its background direction so as to create folds in magnetic field lines while remaining of roughly constant magnitude. The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfvénic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation. We identify and collate several open questions and recommendations for future studies.",

    "title": "A constrained-transport embedded boundary method for compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.",

    "title": "Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma",
    "abstract": "Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $β= 2μ_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$β$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions with uncertainty quantification to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $β$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.",

    "title": "Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations for predicting electron-positron pair production via the linear Breit-Wheeler process",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionise the future of scientific simulations. To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.",

    "title": "A laser plasma soliton fusion scheme",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel fusion scheme enabled by laser-plasma solitons, which promises to overcome several fundamental obstructions to reaching the breakeven condition. For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable.",

After homogenizing the light response, we achieve an energy resolution of 4.37% FWHM at 41.5 keV for $^{83m}$Kr point-like energy deposits contained in a radius of 425 mm. In a fiducial region representing the operating conditions of NEXT-100 at 10 bar we obtain an improved energy resolution of 4.16% FWHM. These results are in good agreement with that obtained in NEXT-White, and an $E^{-1/2}$ extrapolation to $Q_{ββ}$ yields an energy resolution close to 0.5% FWHM, well below the 1% FWHM design target.",

    "title": "Mechanisms of THz Radiation Generation in Multi-Color Laser-Plasma Interactions: A Review Across Diverse Media",
    "abstract": "The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.",

    "title": "Modelling spacecraft-emitted electrons measured by SWA-EAS experiment on board Solar Orbiter mission",
    "abstract": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

    "title": "First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search",
    "abstract": "The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80 K. This work reports the first experimental characterization of an approximately 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The net photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is approximately 4.5 photoelectrons/keV after crosstalk correction, which is rather promising in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.",

    "title": "On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer",
    "abstract": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

    "title": "muT2-NMR: Micro-Scale Correlation Relaxometry for in-situ High-Pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.",

    "title": "Data-driven methods to discover stable linear models of the helicity injectors on HIT-SIU",
    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient circuit models are necessary to control the power electronic circuits found on plasma physics experiments. Tuning and controlling the behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance. Linear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their well-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture nonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system identification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable and accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the injector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade (HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of the interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume, and the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an analytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as well as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a plasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with and without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control and uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.",

    "title": "Measurements of enriched 155 Gd and 157Gd converters with the NMX detector on the nTOF EAR2 beam line at CERN",
    "abstract": "The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the 157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched 157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 % increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %) and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.",

    "title": "Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization",
    "abstract": "The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.",

    "title": "Extreme-ultraviolet synthesis of nanojet-like ejections due to coalescing flux ropes",
    "abstract": "Detection and characterization of small-scale energetic events such as nanoflares and nanojets remain challenging owing to their short lifetimes, small spatial extent, and relatively low energy release, despite their potential role in coronal heating. Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales. However, the lack of synthetic diagnostics has limited the connection between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and observations. In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \\texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.",

    "abstract": "The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $κ= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $κ\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $κ\\to 1.5$ limit.",

The proposed readout method enhances measurement stability and enables reliable device characterization at low bias currents, where the signal-to-noise ratio is typically limited. By effectively suppressing EMI-induced noise, the method improves the ability to distinguish genuine detection events from spurious signals and reduces the effort required for data analysis. The approach has been applied to preliminary measurements of SNSPDs exposed to $α$ particles emitted from a $^{241}$Am source, demonstrating stable operation and clean signal acquisition. While a detailed study of $α$ detection is underway, the method establishes a foundation for further characterization of SNSPDs with various incident particles.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.",

    "title": "Overcoming the space-charge dilemma in low-energy heavy ion beams via a multistage acceleration lens system",
    "abstract": "Low-energy heavy-ion beams are fundamentally limited by severe space-charge divergence, which constrains the transportable beam current to a few microamperes in conventional electrostatic accelerators. This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications.",

    "abstract": "We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.",

    "title": "What Is the Minimum Number of Parameters Required to Represent Solutions of the Grad-Shafranov Equation?",
    "abstract": "Fast and accurate solutions of the Grad--Shafranov (GS) equation are essential for equilibrium analysis, integrated modeling, and surrogate model construction in magnetic confinement fusion. In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria.",

    "abstract": "A reduced kinetic method (RKM) for describing nonlocal transport in magnetized plasmas is derived from first principles and considered in a 1D3V geometry. Unlike standard nonlocal closures, this RKM uses the Fokker-Planck collision operator, therefore local transport results are naturally reproduced for small Knudsen number. An inhibited peak heat flux and preheat of the conductive heat flux are observed, which are expected from physical arguments and previous kinetic studies. Nonlocal behavior of other transport fluxes, namely the Righi-Leduc, Peltier, Ettingshausen, Nernst, thermal force, friction, cross friction, viscous stress, and gyroviscous stress terms are also demonstrated. Neglecting the nonlinear component of the Fokker-Planck collision operator is justified a posteriori. An especially computationally efficient and analytically simpler version of the RKM is presented.",

    "abstract": "We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.",

A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also introduce a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two case studies: a uniform electromagnetic field, and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.",

    "title": "GKFieldFlow: A Spatio-Temporal Neural Surrogate for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Turbulence",
    "abstract": "We present GKFieldFlow, a novel three-dimensional autoregressive deep learning surrogate model for nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence. Based on the architecture FieldFlow-Net, this model combines a multi-resolution 3D U-Net encoder-decoder that operates on evolving plasma potential fields. A dilated temporal convolutional network (TCN) learns the nonlinear time evolution of latent turbulence features. GKFieldFlow simultaneously (i) predicts ion and electron energy fluxes, and particle flux directly from CGYRO turbulence, and (ii) predicts future potential fields autoregressively with desired spatial resolution. This enables the model to replicate both instantaneous transport and the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics that generate it.   The architecture is physics-informed in its design: 3D convolutions preserve the anisotropic geometry and phase structure of gyrokinetic fluctuations, while dilated temporal convolutions capture multiscale dynamical couplings such as turbulence and zonal-flow interactions, turbulence decorrelation, and intermittent bursty transport. We provide a complete technical description of the data structure, model components, and rationale behind each architectural choice.   The model achieves high accuracy across all three transport channels, with multi-horizon inference maintaining robustness. Autoregressive field rollouts preserve the spectral content, phase coherence, and energy distribution of the CGYRO nonlinear state with strong fidelity, and flux predictions remain consistent with CGYRO within a small fractional error. This work presents GKFieldFlow as a data-driven reduced model that can jointly learn turbulence dynamics and transport.",

    "title": "High-throughput, high-brightness, ultrashort 90 keV electrons at 40 kHz",
    "abstract": "Radiofrequency-compressed keV electron sources for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) face competing demands: short pulses require low charge, yet weak scatterers demand high flux; high repetition rates enable signal averaging, yet most systems operate $\\lesssim$1 kHz with low detection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a 90 keV DC-RF source operating at 40 kHz with direct electron detection that address these challenges simultaneously. THz streaking retrieves compressed pulse durations of 97 $\\pm$ 3 fs (FWHM) at 370 aC and 114 $\\pm$ 47 fs (FWHM) at 2.8 fC. Long-term $t_0$ timing drifts, characterized independently both by convolution analysis of compression data and direct THz streaking measurements, lie between 65 - 95 fs (FWHM), among the lowest reported for RF-based systems. At low charge (17 aC), we report an intrinsic pulse duration of 56 fs (FWHM) from comparison of simulations to measured compression data, among the shortest for keV UED at $>$16 aC. Moreover, 2.8 fC bunches, combined with 40 kHz repetition rate and direct detection, produce a detectable normalized throughput that is one (three-to-four) orders of magnitude higher than existing keV (MeV) sources. This enables practical UED studies of weakly scattering samples and processes previously impractical due to low cross-sections and long acquisition times.",

    "title": "Integrated Radiation-Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Magnetized Burning Plasmas. I. Magnetizing Ignition-Class Designs",
    "abstract": "Motivated by breakthroughs in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), first achieving ignition conditions in National Ignition Facility (NIF) shot N210808 and then laser energy breakeven in N221204, modeling efforts here investigate the effect of imposed magnetic fields on integrated hohlraum simulations of igniting systems. Previous NIF experiments have shown yield and hotspot temperature to increase in magnetized, gas-filled capsules in line with scalings. In this work, we use the 2D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Lasnex with a Livermore ICF common model. Simulations are tuned to closely approximate data from unmagnetized experiments. Investigated here is the effect of imposed axial fields of up to 100 T on the fusion output of high-performing ICF shots, specifically the record BigFoot shot N180128, and HYBRID-E shots N210808 and N221204. The main observed effect is an increase in the hotspot temperature due to magnetic insulation. Namely, electron heat flow is constrained perpendicular to the magnetic field and alpha trajectories transition to gyro-orbits, enhancing energy deposition. In addition, we investigate the impact of applied magnetic fields to future NIF designs, specifically an example Enhanced Yield Capability design with 3 MJ of laser energy as well as a high-\\r{ho}R, low implosion velocity \"Pushered Single Shell\" design. In conclusion, magnetization with field strengths of 5-75 T is found to increase the burn-averaged ion temperature by 50% and the neutron yield by 2-12. Specifically, we see yield enhancement of at least 50% with only a 5-10 T applied magnetic field for N221204, while a 65 T field on N210808 with symmetrization gives an 8 increase in yield. This is all without further design optimization to best take advantage of an applied B field, which promises even greater improvements for designs tailored specifically towards magnetization.",

    "abstract": "We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\\mathcal{F}\\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\\times 10^{-23}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\\times 10^{-10}$ $\\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.",

Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) offers the simplest model of reconnection. However, a small uniform resistivity underestimates the reconnection rate compared to first-principles kinetic models. By employing an effective resistivity based on kinetic models - which connects the reconnection electric field to the charge-starved current density - we show that RRMHD can reproduce the increased reconnection rate of kinetic models, both in local current sheets and in global black hole magnetospheres.",

    "title": "Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant",
    "abstract": "Thea Energy, Inc. has developed the preconceptual design for \"Helios,\" a fusion power plant based on the planar coil stellarator architecture. In this overview paper, the design is summarized and the reader is referred to the other papers for more detail. The Helios design is based around a two-field-period quasi-axisymmetric (\"QA\") stellarator equilibrium with aspect ratio 4.5 and a novel tokamak-like X-point divertor. The natural stability, low recirculating power, and steady-state capability of the stellarator are leveraged. Stability and transport are calculated using state-of-the-art, high-fidelity codes and grounded in measured performance of existing experiments. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting (\"HTS\") and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. All coils are planar and convex. A maximum of 20 T on-coil is enforced, a value which has been achieved in existing large-bore HTS coils. There is a minimum of 1.2 m between plasma and coils, leaving space for tritium breeding blanket and neutron shielding. Because of this thick shielding, all coils have a minimum 40-year operational lifetime, the same minimum lifetime of the power plant system. 1.1 GW of thermal power and 390 MW of net electric power are produced. The shaping coils are individually controllable, enabling a uniquely configurable magnetic field for relaxed manufacturing and assembly tolerances and plasma control. A practical maintenance architecture is a primary driver of the design; maintenance is performed on entire toroidal sectors that are removed from between the encircling coils. A biennial maintenance cycle is estimated to take approximately 84 days, resulting in an 88% capacity factor. Rigorous engineering constraints such as temperature and stress limits are enforced.",

    "title": "Variability of MHD Instabilities in Benign Termination of High-Current Runaway Electron Beams in the JET and DIII-D Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "Benign termination, in which magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities deconfine runaway electrons (REs) following hydrogenic injections, is a promising strategy for mitigating dangerous RE loads after disruptions. Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \\geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\\text{edge}} \\approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\\text{edge}} \\geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $δB$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process.",

It illustrates this can be done by first constructing \"building blocks\" that are commonly needed by the wave and Fokker-Planck equations, allowing e.g. to account for wave coupling in plasmas containing non-Maxwellian distributions. Up to details, the paper exploits known expressions and methods to solve the two intimately connected aspects of the description of the wave-particle interaction underlying ion cyclotron resonance heating. Two cases are presented: the case where the guiding centre motion is limited to just following magnetic field lines, and the extended case accounting for drifts away from magnetic surfaces but assuming axisymmetry. A limited set of analytical results is included. As combining wave and Fokker-Planck solving is the focus, the computation of the dielectric response for arbitrary distribution functions is illustrated as well.",

    "title": "Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction",
    "abstract": "Data-driven surrogate models offer quick approximations to complex numerical and experimental systems but typically lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. While Bayesian methods provide uncertainty estimates, they offer no statistical guarantees and struggle with high-dimensional spatio-temporal problems due to computational costs. We present a conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides statistically guaranteed marginal coverage for surrogate models in a model-agnostic manner with near-zero computational cost. Our approach handles high-dimensional spatio-temporal outputs by performing cell-wise calibration while preserving the tensorial structure of predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation across diverse applications including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, weather forecasting, and fusion diagnostics, we demonstrate that CP achieves empirical coverage with valid error bars regardless of model architecture, training regime, or output dimensionality. We evaluate three nonconformity scores (conformalised quantile regression, absolute error residual, and standard deviation) for both deterministic and probabilistic models, showing that guaranteed coverage holds even for out-of-distribution predictions where models are deployed on physics regimes different from training data. Calibration requires only seconds to minutes on standard hardware. The framework enables rigorous validation of pre-trained surrogate models for downstream applications without retraining. While CP provides marginal rather than conditional coverage and assumes exchangeability between calibration and test data, our method circumvents the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional uncertainty quantification approaches, offering a practical tool for trustworthy deployment of machine learning in physical sciences.",

    "title": "Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos",
    "abstract": "Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.",

In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.",

    "title": "Partially Ionized Plasma Physics and Technological Applications",
    "abstract": "Partially ionized plasma physics has attracted a lot of attention recently due to numerous technological applications made possible by the increased sophistication of computer modelling, the depth of the theoretical analysis, and the technological applications to a vast field of the manufacturing for computer components. The partially ionized plasma is characterized by a significant presence of neutral particles in contrast to fully ionized plasma. The theoretical analysis is based upon solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation yielding the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function (EEDF) thereby emphasizing the difference with a fully ionized plasma. The impact of the effect on discharges in inert and molecular gases is described in detail yielding the complex nonlinear phenomena in plasma self-organization. A few examples of such phenomena are given including the non-monotonic EEDFs in the discharge afterglow in mixture of argon with the molecular gas NF3; the explosive generation of cold electron populations in capacitive discharges, hysteresis of EEDF in inductively coupled plasmas. Recently, highly advanced computer codes were developed in order to address the outstanding problems of plasma technology. These developments are briefly described in general terms.",

    "title": "Excess energy of strongly coupled one-component plasma from variational approach",
    "abstract": "The excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is calculated using the variational approach combined with different variants of the excess entropy of the hard-sphere fluid, which is used as a reference system. Our comparison with recent Monte Carlo results for the excess energy of the one-component plasma identifies the Percus-Yevick virial entropy as the most accurate entropy to be used in the variational calculation of this kind. The reason for this and potential developments of the present analysis are briefly discussed. We demonstrate that the original Rosenfeld-Tarazons scaling of the thermal component of the excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is in excellent agreement with recent Monte Carlo results.",
