  "title": "Improving Muon Scattering Tomography Performance With A Muon Momentum   Measurement Scheme",
  "abstract": "Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the \"equi-percentage scheme\", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.",
