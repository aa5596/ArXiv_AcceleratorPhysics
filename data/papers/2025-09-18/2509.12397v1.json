  "title": "Shock wave bending around a dusty plasma void",
  "abstract": "We report on experimental observations of the bending of a dust acoustic shock wave around a dust void region. This phenomenon occurs as a planar shock wavefront encounters a compressible obstacle in the form of a void whose size is larger than the wavelength of the wave. As they collide, the central portion of the wavefront, that is the first to touch the void, is blocked while the rest of the front continues to propagate, resulting in an inward bending of the shock wave. The bent shock wave eventually collapses, leading to the transient trapping of dust particles in the void. Subsequently, a Coulomb explosion of the trapped particles generates a bow shock. The experiments have been carried out in a DC glow discharge plasma, where the shock wave and the void are simultaneously created as self-excited modes of a three-dimensional dust cloud. The salient features of this phenomenon are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations, which provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of this interaction.",
