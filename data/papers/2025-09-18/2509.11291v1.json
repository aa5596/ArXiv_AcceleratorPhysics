  "title": "Enhancing Electromagnetic Calorimeter Signal Reconstruction with Machine   Learning-Based Noise Discrimination",
  "abstract": "Calorimeters operating in high-radiation environments are susceptible to damage, leading to increased noise that can significantly degrade energy resolution. A common way to mitigate noise is to apply a higher energy threshold on the cells, typically set a few standard deviations above the noise level. However, this method risks discarding cells with genuine energy deposits, worsening the energy resolution. In this paper we explore various machine learning (ML) algorithms that can replace a rigid threshold on the reconstructed cell energy and we demonstrate the improvement in calorimetric energy reconstruction and energy resolution that these ML methods can achieve in such challenging conditions.",
