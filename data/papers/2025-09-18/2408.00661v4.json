  "title": "Neuromorphic detection and cooling of microparticles in arrays",
  "abstract": "Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would offer increased sensitivity, directionality, and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present a scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle tracking and control by implementing real-time feedback to {simultaneously cool the motion of three uncoupled microscale objects",
