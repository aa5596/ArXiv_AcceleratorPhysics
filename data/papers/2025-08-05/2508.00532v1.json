  "title": "Utilizing Deep Learning for Enhanced Tritium Detection in CCDs",
  "abstract": "This study explores the use of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for detecting low-energy beta particles from tritium decay - a critical signal for nuclear safety, nuclear nonproliferation, and environmental monitoring. We employ a dual approach utilizing both measured CCD data and detailed Geant4 simulations. Our analysis compares classical techniques with advanced deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders trained exclusively on tritium data, and preliminary studies on boosted decision trees (BDTs). The CNN, trained on mixed signal/background datasets, demonstrates superior classification performance, while the autoencoder shows the potential of unsupervised, background-agnostic strategies. These results highlight the excellent sensitivity achievable thanks to the background rejection made possible by information-rich CCD data, paving the way for improved portable tritium monitoring.",
