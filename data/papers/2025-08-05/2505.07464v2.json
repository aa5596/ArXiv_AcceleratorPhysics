  "title": "Development of the Range Counter for the COMET Phase-$Î±$ Experiment",
  "abstract": "The COMET Phase-$\\alpha$ experiment aims to evaluate the novel muon transport beamline for the muon-to-electron conversion search at J-PARC, Japan. A dedicated Range Counter (RC) was developed to measure the momentum spectrum of transported negative muons with momenta of 30--100 MeV/$c$. The RC consists of graphite momentum degraders, a muon absorber, and plastic scintillation counters ($\\rm T_0$, $\\rm T_1$, and $\\rm T_2$) to detect decay-in-orbit (DIO) electrons from stopped muons. The number of muons stopped in the absorber is reconstructed from the decay time distribution. A copper absorber was selected due to the short lifetime of muonic atoms in copper, which enhances signal separation. The counters' performance was evaluated experimentally. The $\\rm T_0$ Counter, made of a $200\\times 200\\times 0.5~{\\rm mm^3}$ scintillator plate, achieved a muon-trigger efficiency exceeding 99.9%. The $\\rm T_1$ and $\\rm T_2$ Counters also demonstrated high electron-detection efficiencies of $>99$%. Based on these results, simulation studies estimate the acceptance for reconstructing the number of DIO electrons from the absorber to be approximately 47% with a corresponding signal purity of 60% against muon capture-induced backgrounds.",
