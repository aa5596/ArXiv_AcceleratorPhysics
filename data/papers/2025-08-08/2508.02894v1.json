  "title": "Nb3Sn coating of SRF cavity by co-sputtering from a composite target",
  "abstract": "We deposited Nb3Sn film on the inner surface of a 2.6 GHz Nb superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity by co-sputtering using a composite of Nb and Sn tube targets in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system, followed by thermal annealing of the coated cavity. An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize the deposition parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42 at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, achieving a Tc of 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance of the cavity, primarily due to the improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.",
