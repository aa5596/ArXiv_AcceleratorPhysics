    "title": "Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs",
    "abstract": "Persistent single-electron emission (\"hot spots\") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.",

    "title": "Controlling the electric force on a dust particle during the afterglow   of a plasma at a higher gas pressure",
    "abstract": "When dust particles are immersed in a plasma, and the power that sustains a plasma is terminated, the charge of dust particles will change in the early afterglow, as electrons and ions gradually diminish in number. The possibility of controlling this charge, along with the electric force acting on the particles in the late afterglow, has earlier been demonstrated at a low gas pressure of 8 mTorr. Here, it is confirmed experimentally that controlling particles is possible also at a higher gas pressure of 90 mTorr, in a capacitively coupled radio-frequency plasma (CCP). A timed application of a DC electric field during the afterglow is a key element of this control scheme. Analyzing the experimental results, the electric force in the late afterglow was determined by comparing measurements of particle velocity to a prediction made by integrating the equation of motion, taking into account gas friction. In addition to applying friction to dust particles, gas also slows the drifting motion of electrons and ions, reducing their energy during the afterglow, but nevertheless we find that dust particles become charged in the afterglow so that one can apply an electric force to them that is comparable to the gravitational force, even at a higher pressure than had previously been demonstrated. This result extends the parameter range for which it is expected that particle contamination in semiconductor manufacturing can be mitigated by controlling charge and forces during the afterglow. Because of the way that forces scale with particle size, it is expected that submicron particles can be controlled even more easily than the larger spheres in the present experiment.",

    "abstract": "Until now, quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields have been the only known stellarator configurations that, at low collisionality, give small radial neoclassical transport and zero bootstrap current for arbitrary plasma profiles, the latter facilitating control of the magnetic configuration. The recently introduced notion of piecewise omnigenous fields has enormously broadened the space of stellarator configurations with small radial neoclassical transport. In this Letter, the existence of piecewise omnigenous fields that give zero bootstrap current is proven analytically and confirmed numerically. These results establish piecewise omnigenity as an alternative approach to stellarator reactor design.",

    "title": "Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective   Magnetic Walls",
    "abstract": "Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding compressible turbulence is critical for modeling atmospheric, astrophysical, and engineering flows. However, compressible turbulence poses a more significant challenge than incompressible turbulence. We present a novel mathematical framework to compute \\textit{mode-to-mode energy transfer rates} and energy fluxes for compressible flows. The formalism captures detailed energy conservation within triads and allows decomposition of transfers into rotational, compressive, and mixed components, providing a clear picture of energy exchange among velocity and internal energy modes. We also establish analogies with incompressible hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic flows, highlighting the framework's universality in studying energy transfers.",

    "title": "Stabilization and Re-excitation of Sawtooth Oscillations due to   Energetic Particles in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "Sawtooth oscillations, driven by internal kink modes (IKMs), are fundamental phenomena in tokamak plasmas. They can be classified into different types, including normal sawteeth, small sawteeth, and in some cases, evolving into the steady-island state, each having a different impact on energy confinement in fusion reactors. This study investigates the interaction between sawtooth oscillations and energetic particles (EPs) using the initial-value MHD-kinetic hybrid code CLT-K, which can perform long-term self-consistent nonlinear simulations. We analyze the redistribution of EPs caused by sawtooth crashes and the effect of EPs on sawtooth behavior and type transitions. The results show that co-passing EPs tend to re-excite sawtooth oscillations, extending their period, while counter-passing EPs promote the system evolution toward small sawteeth, potentially leading to the steady-island state. Additionally, we provide a physical picture of how EPs influence sawtooth type through the mechanism of magnetic flux pumping. We demonstrate that the radial residual flow in the core plays a crucial role in determining the reconnection rate and sawtooth type. Moreover, we observe new phenomena about couplings of various instabilities, such as the excitation of global multi-mode toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (TAEs) due to EP redistribution following a sawtooth crash and the excitation of the resonant tearing mode (r-TM) when injecting counter-passing EPs. The study also explores the impact of EP energy and the safety factor profile on the development of stochastic magnetic fields and EP transport. These findings emphasize the necessity of multi-mode simulations in capturing the complexity of EP-sawtooth interactions and provide insights for optimizing sawtooth control in future reactors such as ITER.",

    "abstract": "Material damage thresholds pose a fundamental limit to chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in high-power laser systems. Plasma-based amplification via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) offers a damage-free alternative, yet its effectiveness has been hindered by instabilities that constrain interaction length. In this study, we report the first experimental demonstration of SBS amplification driven by a flying focus in a 3-mm plasma channel. The flying focus is generated using chromatic aberration from spherical lenses, with its velocity precisely measured by an interferometric ionization method achieving 6.6 fs timing resolution. At a focus velocity near -c, SBS amplification is realized at pump and seed intensities more than two orders of magnitude lower than in conventional setups, yielding a conversion efficiency of 14.5%. These results validate flying focus as a powerful tool for extending interaction lengths and enabling efficient plasma-based laser amplification at reduced intensities.",

    "abstract": "We present a comparative study of transport in two optimized stellarator configurations: Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and a recent design called Quasi-Symmetric Turbulence Konzept (QSTK). Using global Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC), we explore the role of zonal flows (ZFs) in suppressing electrostatic Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in both configurations. The simulations reveal that ZFs significantly reduce ion heat transport in both W7-X and QSTK, with a lower value of heat flux on the latter configuration, as suggested by the apparently higher linear threshold (''critical'') gradients for ITG modes. The study also highlights that both stellarators exhibit similar mode structures. The results support the notion that linear stability measures, in combination with nonlinear stabilization by zonal flows, can play an important role in the suppression of nonlinear heat fluxes.",

To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.",

    "abstract": "Experiments using high-power lasers and relativistic electron beams will soon be capable of precision testing of the theory of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. The comparison between experiment and theory always occurs via numerical simulations, but the lack of quantitative uncertainty bounds for the latter means that the origin of any discrepancies cannot be identified conclusively. Here I present a simulation framework that can place meaningful bounds on the theory uncertainties inherent to its operation. This work shows that the use of the locally constant field approximation leads to a theory uncertainty of a few per cent in the signals of quantum radiation reaction expected in near-term experiments.",

In this Letter, we present the beam physics and experimental demonstration of a new method that, for the first time, enables simultaneous control of bunch duration and synchronization with few-fs precision. Timing stabilization is achieved using a tailored high-gradient $\\alpha$-magnet that optimizes the correlation between time of flight and momentum, together with a photocathode RF gun designed to suppress the effect of RF-to-laser timing jitter. Compression is realized by manipulating the time-momentum correlation in phase space, primarily through space-charge effects. Sub-5-fs rms bunch duration and synchronization are demonstrated. This method establishes a new regime in electron bunch control, unlocking new capabilities for ultrafast beam physics and applications.",

    "title": "Holovibes: real-time ultrahigh-speed digital hologram rendering and   short-time analysis",
    "abstract": "Real-time ultrahigh-speed rendering of digital holograms from high-bitrate interferogram streams demands robust parallel computing and efficient data handling with minimal latency. We present Holovibes, a high-performance software engine that enables real-time holographic image reconstruction and short-time analysis at unprecedented throughput. Holovibes integrates spatial demodulation techniques, such as Fresnel transformations and angular spectrum propagation, with temporal analysis methods including short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and principal component analysis (PCA) in a unified pipeline. By leveraging CUDA-based GPU acceleration, multithreaded parallelism, and efficient buffering, the system achieves high-throughput, low-latency processing suitable for demanding computational imaging applications. We demonstrate sustained real-time hologram rendering of 256x256-pixel from interferograms acquired by a streaming camera at 71,400 frames per second on commodity hardware with no frame loss, while maintaining an end-to-end latency of 30 ms. The engine also supports simultaneous recording of raw or processed data, enabling high-speed acquisition workflows essential for experimental applications. This work represents a significant advance over prior digital holography systems and provides a versatile platform for ultra-high-speed, real-time computational imaging.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.",

    "title": "Machine-learned trends in mirror configurations in the Large Plasma   Device",
    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the efficacy of ML-based trend inference using data from the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). The LAPD is a flexible basic plasma science device with a high discharge repetition rate (0.25-1 Hz) and reproducible plasmas capable of collecting high-spatial-resolution probe measurements. A diverse dataset is collected through random sampling of LAPD operational parameters, including the magnetic field strength and profile, fueling settings, and the discharge voltage. NN ensembles with uncertainty quantification are trained to predict time-averaged ion saturation current ($I_\\text{sat}$ -- proportional to density and the square root of electron temperature) at any position within the dataset domain. Model-inferred trends, such as the effects of introducing mirrors or changing the discharge voltage, are consistent with current understanding. In addition, axial variation is optimized via comprehensive search over $I_\\text{sat}$ predictions. Experimental validation of these optimized machine parameters demonstrate qualitative agreement, with quantitative differences attributable to Langmuir probe variation and cathode conditions. This investigation demonstrates, using ML techniques, a new way of extracting insight from experiments and novel optimization of plasmas. The code and data used in this study are made freely available.",

    "title": "Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent   dynamo",
    "abstract": "Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, introducing a bulk viscosity into the plasma via the internal degrees of freedom of the molecular composition, directly impacting the decay of compressible modes, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes in the interstellar medium, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$, we perform trans-sonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\\rm{P}\\nu \\equiv \\rm{Re}_{\\rm bulk} / \\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$, where $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. We derive a framework for decomposing $E_{\\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\\nabla\\otimes\\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$ play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in compressible dynamos. In the absence of $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ ($\\rm{P}\\nu \\to \\infty$), $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$ pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\\rm{P}\\nu \\approx 1$. (abridged). We emphasize the importance of further understanding the role of $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas, which we estimate could be as strong as the shear viscosity in the cold ISM, and highlight that compressible direct numerical simulations without bulk viscosity have unresolved compressible mode dissipation scales.",

A distinctive feature of these modes-emerging above the electron cyclotron frequency-is their collisionless damping, which arises from resonant coupling to a continuum of upper-hybrid modes localized within a smooth plasma-vacuum transition layer. We demonstrate both temporal and spatial damping of TSPWs at the boundary of a cylindrical magnetized plasma. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field, the TSPW exhibits a smooth and continuous transition, highlighting its topological robustness under magnetic inhomogeneity.",

    "title": "A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp rate is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp rates are less than the ramp rates in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp rates are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.",

    "abstract": "The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder, optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.   Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic feedback during operations.   This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.   The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data taking.",

    "title": "Towards a realistic noise modelling of quantum sensors for future   satellite gravity missions",
    "abstract": "Mapping the Earth's gravity field from space offers valuable insights into climate change, hydro- and biosphere evolution, and seismic activity. Current satellite gravimetry missions have demonstrated the utility of gravity data in understanding global mass transport phenomena, climate dynamics, and geological processes. However, state-of-the-art measurement techniques face noise and long-term drift limitations, which propagate into the recovery of Earth's time-varying gravity field. Quantum sensors, particularly Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI), offer promise for improving the accuracy and stability of space-based gravity measurements. Therefore, CAI has emerged as a promising measurement technique for future gravimetric satellite missions due to their potential for measuring gravitational forces and gradients with high precision and accuracy, particularly at low frequencies (sub-mHz). This study explores the sensitivity of CAI accelerometers and gradiometers to the errors in measuring the satellite's attitude. We explore the low-low satellite-to-satellite and gravity gradiometry concepts and build the respective analytical models of measurements and associated errors. We selected an ambitious scenario for CAI parameters that illustrates a potential path for increasing instrument accuracies and capabilities for space gravimetry. Two operational modes, concurrent (where a new cloud is generated while another is moved to the interferometric chamber) and sequential (where cloud generation and interferometry happen in the same place), are compared to mitigate the effects of inaccurately known attitude rates on Coriolis accelerations. The sequential mode shows the potential to reduce these effects since the atom cloud has an initial zero velocity. [...]",

AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.   The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.   Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.   This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.",

The wave kinetic equation describing kinetic Alfv\\'{e}n wave spectral cascading via resonant three-wave interactions is derived, and the stationary spectra are analytically obtained using the Zakharov transformation in both the long-wavelength limit and the short-wavelength limit, for both counter-propagating and co-propagating cases. The cascade directions of stationary solutions are identified and their existence is further verified by numerical solution of the wave kinetic equation. A brief discussion on the relevance of such predictions to the solar wind turbulence and helical kinetic-Alfv\\'{e}nic turbulence is presented.",

    "title": "Mechanical Characterisation of Silicon for the ETpathfinder Test Masses",
    "abstract": "The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, is designed to reduce noise in a wide band of frequencies compared to the current generation, through the use of new technologies. ETpathfinder, designed as an R&D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the Leibniz-Institut f\\\"ur Kristallz\\\"uchtung. This material choice was made to pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed. Predictions are made of the contribution of the mirror substrate material to the overall ETpathfinder noise budget.",

Turbulence damping at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales closely follows linear transit-time damping theory. Despite strong phase steepening, turbulence sustains robust cross-scale energy cascading. These findings resolve the long-standing question about the validity of classical wave theories in strongly nonlinear regimes and overturn the common presumption that wave steepening disrupts compressible turbulence cascade, thereby providing a more complete picture of MHD turbulence.",

The experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented accuracy, seeking potential discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. We trace the evolution of this measurement from its beginnings at CERN in the 1960s to the current state-of-the-art experiment at Fermilab, highlighting the remarkable engineering achievements required to achieve parts-per-billion precision. Recent results from Runs 1-3 have achieved a systematic uncertainty of 70 ppb, exceeding design goals, while ongoing theoretical calculations continue to refine predictions. Despite these advances, the analysis remains statistics-limited, with continued data collection and novel experimental approaches at MUonE and J-PARC promising further insights into this fundamental physical quantity.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of high-power Yb-based ultrafast laser-amplifier systems has opened the possibility of air filamentation at high repetition rates >1 kHz. In this new regime, accumulation effects cannot be ruled out, therefore, characterizing the plasma parameters and afterglow plasma-chemical kinetics becomes increasingly relevant. In this work, we use optical emission spectroscopy to measure nanosecond dynamics of gas temperature and electron temperature, species-specific decay times, and electron density of an atmospheric air laser filament produced by high average power femtosecond laser at a high repetition rate of 10 kHz. The molecular excitation mechanisms behind the nitrogen photoemissions are derived from vibrational distributions and temporal behavior of the studied emission bands. The presented diagnostic technique offers a complementary but more holistic measurement approach to optical probe schemes to characterize the laser-filament-induced plasma wake for high repetition rate filaments.",

    "title": "Control of cross-beam energy transfer through laser-plasma parameter   adjustment",
    "abstract": "Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) between two lasers is investigated through both analytical theory and two-dimensional simulations, with particular attention to its linear and nonlinear evolution under various laser-plasma conditions over timescales from several hundred picoseconds to one nanosecond. Based on the dispersion relation of stimulated Brillouin scattering driven by two laser beams, we obtain a laser frequency difference range within which CBET occurs. In the nonlinear regime, high harmonic of ion acoustic wave (IAW) leads to the reduction of saturation level at high laser intensities ($I\\gtrsim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{W/cm^2}$). The wave breaking of harmonic IAW causes the second growth and final saturation of CBET. At low intensities, the linear saturation level slowly varies over time. Compared to Gaussian beams, smoothed lasers with speckles can mitigate CBET saturation level by reducing the effective overlap region. The maximum energy transfer is found at a frequency difference slightly smaller than the linear matching condition due to the reduction of IAW frequency induced by ion trapping. We find that the nonlinear behavior is sensitive to laser intensity, frequency difference, electron density, and ion temperature. The total energy transfer rate increases approximately linearly with laser intensity, underscoring its critical role in CBET control.",

    "title": "Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments",
    "abstract": "Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation. A faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, a coil with inductance of 491 ${\\mu}H$ and resistance of 0.26 ${\\Omega}$, corresponding to a time constant of ~1.9 ms, is driven so that its current faithfully follows the control signals from -1A to +1A. Capable of completing a full-scale transition in just ~31 ${\\mu}s$, with an effective bandwidth of 15.2 kHz. This corresponds to an improvement by a factor of more than 20 in both bandwidth and switching speed over a conventional power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, both the bandwidth and the switching time can be tuned to match specific needs within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.",

    "title": "Non-linear MHD modelling of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade",
    "abstract": "Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigation system in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency and prompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations, while additional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution and radiation property of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., a collisional-radiative model is used. Neon fraction scans between 0 - 10% are performed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is abruptly lost, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the neon fraction. In the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiation plays a dominant role. In case of pure deuterium injection, this second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\\sim $20%) of the total material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets ($\\leq 0.12\\%$) due to the full thermal collapse of the plasma occurring later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetration speed are then numerically studied, showing that slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker.",

    "title": "Nb3Sn coating of SRF cavity by co-sputtering from a composite target",
    "abstract": "We deposited Nb3Sn film on the inner surface of a 2.6 GHz Nb superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity by co-sputtering using a composite of Nb and Sn tube targets in a DC cylindrical magnetron sputtering system, followed by thermal annealing of the coated cavity. An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize the deposition parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42 at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, achieving a Tc of 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance of the cavity, primarily due to the improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-heterodyne scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) is applied in the mid-infrared region to detect the chemical composition of biomolecules on the nanoscale. However, the application of sSNOM in molecular biology has been limited to static images in air. Recently, bottom illumination sSNOM (BI-sSNOM) was developed for operation in water. Yet, the scan rate of sSNOM remains a bottleneck to record protein structural changes in aqueous solution on the seconds time scale. We designed an optical and mechanical system consisting of a separate scan high-speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM) coupled to the BI-sSNOM optics. The designed AFM scanner has a mechanical bandwidth of ca 70 kHz along the Z-axis, and ca 6 kHz along the XY-axis, equivalent to the sample scanning HS-AFM. The AFM performance is demonstrated by imaging actin filaments. The optical design is validated by sSNOM experiments on purple membranes and microtubules.",

Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four HMHD fields $(\\phi,\\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, which retains finite electron inertia, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.",

    "title": "Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole   Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra",
    "abstract": "The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles. The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions. Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA), computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation. This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators, this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both alternatives.",

    "title": "An Online Data Analysis Framework for Accelerator-Based Physics   Experiments",
    "abstract": "A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on diagnostic data is of crucial importance to physics experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June 2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with minimal modification.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of two counterstreaming weakly collisional plasma flows in a magnetic field of an arch configuration is considered. Hybrid numerical simulations show that in a system whose dimensions are close to the ion Larmor radius, more intense interaction dynamics are observed, the magnetic arch experiences a significant expansion with the formation of a region with an irregular character of magnetic lines, in which magnetic reconnection processes occur. In this case, the generation of a surface wave of the ion-cyclotron range is observed at the boundaries of the arch. An increase in the scale of the system compared to the ion Larmor radius leads to a transition to the ideal MHD regime, in which the evolution of the arch occurs much more slowly, and the development of instabilities is not observed.",

This work presents results from the commissioning of an essential version of the experiment at the shallow Underground Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich. For the first time, two cryogenic target detectors were tested alongside active and passive shielding systems. Over a period of two months all detector subsystems were operated with stable performance. Background measurements were conducted, providing important benchmarks for the modeling of background sources at the reactor site. Finally, we present ongoing efforts to upgrade the detector systems in preparation for a technical run at Chooz in 2026, and highlight the remaining challenges to achieving neutrino detection.",

    "title": "Gyrotropy-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Erosion Hot Spots on Antenna   Limiters during High-Power Tokamak RF Operation: Mechanisms and Mitigation   Strategies",
    "abstract": "Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control (which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\\sim$3 and reducing total erosion by a factor of $\\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust, reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.",

The energy deposition spectrum of gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0 V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical photons.

    "title": "Imposing quasineutrality on electrostatic plasmas via the Dirac theory   of constraints",
    "abstract": "We present a method for imposing quasineutrality and, more generally, charge density conservation in the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) and Vlasov-Amp\\`ere (VA) systems, which describe electrostatic plasma dynamics, by applying the Dirac theory of constraints. Leveraging the Hamiltonian field formulations of the VP and VA models, we construct generalized Dirac brackets using the Dirac algorithm. The resulting constrained systems enforce charge density conservation, and consequently quasineutrality, through new advection terms in the Vlasov equations involving generalized-force terms, while the electric field is eliminated from the constrained Vlasov dynamics. To verify charge density conservation we conduct one-dimensional numerical experiments using a semi-Lagrangian method, demonstrating that the enforcement of the quasineutrality constraint significantly modifies the dynamics. This approach enables us to identify the forces required to enforce quasineutrality, offering a systematic way to assess the validity of the quasineutral approximation across different kinetic scales.",

    "title": "Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial   Localization and Tracking",
    "abstract": "Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.",

    "abstract": "Polarized particle sources have a plethora of applications, ranging from deep-inelastic scattering to nuclear fusion. One crucial challenge in laser-plasma interaction is maintaining the initial polarization of the target. Here, we propose the acceleration of spin-polarized Helium-3 from near-critical density targets using high-intensity Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that Magnetic Vortex Acceleration with these modes yields higher polarization on the 90%-level compared to conventional Gaussian laser pulses, while also providing low-divergence beams.",

    "title": "Orientational Effects in the Low Pair Continuum of Aluminium",
    "abstract": "We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.",

    "title": "Mechanical strength investigations of the APPLE-X undulator using Fiber   Bragg Grating strain measurements",
    "abstract": "The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.",

    "title": "Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision",
    "abstract": "We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.",
