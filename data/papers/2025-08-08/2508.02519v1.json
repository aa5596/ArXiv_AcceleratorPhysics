  "title": "Influence of finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of   weakly-collisional plasma jets colliding in magnetic arch",
  "abstract": "The effect of the finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of two counterstreaming weakly collisional plasma flows in a magnetic field of an arch configuration is considered. Hybrid numerical simulations show that in a system whose dimensions are close to the ion Larmor radius, more intense interaction dynamics are observed, the magnetic arch experiences a significant expansion with the formation of a region with an irregular character of magnetic lines, in which magnetic reconnection processes occur. In this case, the generation of a surface wave of the ion-cyclotron range is observed at the boundaries of the arch. An increase in the scale of the system compared to the ion Larmor radius leads to a transition to the ideal MHD regime, in which the evolution of the arch occurs much more slowly, and the development of instabilities is not observed.",
