  "title": "Free electron charging of microdroplets in a plasma at atmospheric   pressure",
  "abstract": "Gas-phase microdroplets have recently demonstrated exceptional chemical properties via suspected mechanisms such as contact electrification and surface charge pinning, producing high surface electric fields. Here, microdroplets are injected into a low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma and exposed to an excess free-electron flux. We report the first measurements of droplet charge in a fully collisional plasma, with averages up to 2.5 $\\times 10^{5}$ electrons for 15 $\\mu$m droplets, dependent on absorbed power. Simulations indicate solid particles under similar conditions acquire $\\sim$40\\% less charge, likely due to low-mobility water cluster ion formation around evaporating droplets, and predict surface electric fields up to $10^{7}$ V m$^{-1}$ for the smallest droplets (3 $\\mu$m). Plasma exposure also produces H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ in the liquid, with concentrations up to 33 mM, corresponding to remarkable generation rates exceeding 275 M s$^{-1}$. The system involves complex, not yet fully elucidated mechanisms. A controlled plasma environment enables defined charge levels and exposure times, allowing systematic study and enhancing droplet properties.",
