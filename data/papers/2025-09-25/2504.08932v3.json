  "title": "AC-LGADs Fermilab Front-End Electronics Characterization",
  "abstract": "We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the time resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\\: ps$ at the $1\\sigma$ level.",
