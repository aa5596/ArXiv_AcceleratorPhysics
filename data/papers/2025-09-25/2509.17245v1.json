  "title": "Relativistically-strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas",
  "abstract": "Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\\omega^\\ast - k^\\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\\omega) \\geq B_0$, cannot propagate.",
