  "title": "Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for   collinear laser spectroscopy",
  "abstract": "A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.",
