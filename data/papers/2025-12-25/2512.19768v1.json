  "title": "A Dynamical-Time Framework for the Dynamics of Charged Particles",
  "abstract": "We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of the time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two study cases: an uniform electromagnetic field and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.",
