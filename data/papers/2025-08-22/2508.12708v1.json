  "title": "A Neural-Network Framework for Tracking and Identification of Cosmic-Ray   Nuclei in the RadMap Telescope",
  "abstract": "We present a neural-network framework designed to reconstruct the properties of cosmic-ray nuclei traversing the scintillating-fiber tracking calorimeter of the RadMap Telescope. Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\\circ$ and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\\%$ for nuclei with $Z\\leq8$; specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\\%$ for hydrogen. The energy resolution is $<20\\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.",
