  "title": "Record Magnetic Field Generation by Short-Pulse Laser-Driven   Capacitor-Coil Targets",
  "abstract": "Magnetic fields generated by capacitor-coil targets driven by intense short-pulse lasers have been characterized using ultrafast proton radiography. A 1-kJ, 15-ps laser at a center wavelength of 1053 nm irradiated the back plate of the capacitor with an intensity of $\\sim$8.3 $\\times$ 10$^{18}$ W$/$cm$^{2}$, creating ultra large currents in the connecting coils. High-quality proton data obtained in the axial probing geometry show definitive signatures of magnetic field generation allowing precision measurement of the field distribution and strength. The data show a coil current of 120 $\\pm$ 10 kA producing 200 $\\pm$ 20 Tesla magnetic fields at the coil center at 1.127 ns afer the laser drive. This sets a record for magnetic field generation by the short-pulse-powered capacitor-coil targets.",
