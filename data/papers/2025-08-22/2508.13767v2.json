  "title": "Mueller Matrix Polarimetry of Fiber Bragg Grating Strain and Torsion",
  "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate a polarimetric dual-comb spectroscopy technique for simultaneous strain and torsion sensing using a single-cavity mode-locked fiber laser and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Dual-comb generation in a single-cavity fiber laser was achieved by utilizing a piece of high-birefringence fiber and adjusting the in-cavity polarization controller. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was applied to the time-domain Stokes parameters, enabling the detection of FBG spectral shifts induced by strain and torsion. To further enhance discrimination between strain and torsion, we applied a novel approach to extract Mueller matrix elements without using complex adjustable polarization components. We explored the analysis of polarimetric purity of the FBG's Mueller matrix in terms of polarizance, diattenuation, and structural polarization response as a function of FBG strain and torsion. The obtained results enabled the measurement of strain and torsion based on a single FBG, which paves the way for the development of cost-effective shape sensing technologies.",
