  "title": "Real-time alpha-ray track imaging using a synthetic diamond scintillator",
  "abstract": "We demonstrated real-time imaging of alpha-ray tracks using a high-pressure, high-temperature synthetic diamond scintillator. The optical microscopy system consisted of a magnification objective lens and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) to detect luminescence from the diamond substrate irradiated with alpha-rays from a 241Am source. Optical images of alpha-ray tracks were successfully captured under ambient conditions, and image processing methods were performed to enable automatic event recognition and track length detection. These results demonstrate that diamond is a promising scintillator material for alpha-ray imaging, representing an important step toward exploiting the potential of diamond scintillators",
