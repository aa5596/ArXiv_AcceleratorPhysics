  "title": "Novel Limits on Dark Photon Mixing from Radiation Safety",
  "abstract": "I propose a novel laboratory search for dark photons based on radiation-safety monitoring at synchrotron radiation facilities, including NanoTerasu, SPring-8, KEK-PF, and ESRF. Dark photons can be produced parasitically in undulators or via photon-mirror interactions, and subsequently traverse optical systems and shielding. Taking into account quantum effects and the internal structure of undulators, mirrors, and detectors, I show that even a simple Geiger-M\\\"uller counter, routinely used for radiation-safety monitoring, can detect such dark photons outside the shielding and set competitive limits on the kinetic mixing parameter down to $\\chi \\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-6}$ in the eV mass range, providing some of the strongest bounds among laboratory searches. Because radiation safety is strictly regulated, the resulting limits can be regarded as robust and realistic constraints.",
