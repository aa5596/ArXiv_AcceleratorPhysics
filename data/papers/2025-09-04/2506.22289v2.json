  "title": "Metriplectic bracket for guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau theory",
  "abstract": "The metriplectic formulation of collisional guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau theory is presented. The guiding-center Landau collision operator, which describes collisions involving test-particle and field-particle guiding-center orbits, is represented in terms of a symmetric dissipative bracket involving functional derivatives of the guiding-center Vlasov phase-space density $F_{\\rm gc}$ and the electromagnetic fields $({\\bf D}_{\\rm gc},{\\bf B})$, where the guiding-center displacement vector ${\\bf D}_{\\rm gc} \\equiv {\\bf E} + 4\\pi\\,{\\sf P}_{\\rm gc}$ is expressed in terms of the electric field ${\\bf E}$ and the guiding-center polarization ${\\sf P}_{\\rm gc}$. This dissipative Landau bracket conserves guiding-center energy-momentum and angular momentum, as well as satisfying a guiding-center H-theorem.",
