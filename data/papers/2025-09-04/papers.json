    "title": "Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and   plasma density for laser-plasma experiments",
    "abstract": "Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.   Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.   In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.",

    "title": "Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins",
    "abstract": "Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.",

    "abstract": "The SiPM-on-Tile technology for highly granular calorimeters, where small plastic scintillator tiles are directly read out with SiPMs, has been developed for the CALICE Analog Hadron Calorimeter, and has been adopted for parts of the hadronic section of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. For future electron-positron colliders, a single cell time stamping on the sub-nanosecond level for energy deposits corresponding to single minimum-ionizing particles is desired to provide background rejection and to support pattern recognition and energy reconstruction with particle flow algorithms. To better understand the time resolution achievable with the SiPM-on-Tile technology, we have performed detailed measurements in test beams at DESY, probing scintillator tiles of different sizes. The study is complemented by laser measurements that provide insights into processes within the scintillator tile relevant for timing. In this publication, we will discuss our measurement methods and the results of our SiPM-on-Tile timing study.",

    "title": "Second harmonic generation by radially polarized laser beam propagating   in homogeneous plasma",
    "abstract": "This study presents an investigation of second harmonic generation (SHG) resulting from interaction of radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma. Lorentz force and continuity equations have been used to derive the radial and axial current density components. Further, using these densities in the wave equation leads to analytical expressions for the SHG field amplitudes. These amplitudes exhibit periodic oscillations along the propagation axis, characterized by detuning length dependent on plasma density and laser parameters. Radial and axial contributions to SHG are found to be highly enhanced near the beam axis due to the Gaussian beam profile of the laser. The analytical findings are validated using Fourier Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulations. Notably, unlike linearly or circularly polarized beams which require either inhomogeneous or magnetized plasma, radially polarized beams facilitate efficient harmonic generation in homogeneous unmagnetized plasmas.",

    "abstract": "We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.",

    "title": "Towards AMS measurements of $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo produced   in fusion environment",
    "abstract": "Long-lived radionuclides, such as $^{91}$Nb, $^{94}$Nb and $^{93}$Mo, are expected to be produced in nuclear fusion reactors by reactions of high-energy neutrons with the structural material. Accurate predictions of waste categorization require experimental validation of simulation codes like FISPACT-II. This work explores the use of Ion-Laser InterAction Mass Spectrometry (ILIAMS) at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) to measure these three radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The ILIAMS setup employs laser photodetachment to suppress their respective stable isobars: $^{91}$Zr, $^{94}$Zr and $^{94}$Mo, and $^{93}$Nb. For $^{91,94}$Nb measurements, NbO$_3^-$ is selected, with interferences from ZrO$_3^-$ suppressed by collisions with the He buffer gas in the ion cooler. The suppression can be enhanced by overlapping a 355\\,nm laser with the ion beam. The lower limit for the suppression factor is 37000. In that way, we reach $^{91}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb and $^{94}$Zr/$^{93}$Nb levels of $1.2\\,\\times\\,10^{-14}$ and $1.8\\,\\times\\,10^{-14}$, respectively, in targets prepared from commercial Nb$_2$O$_5$. MoO$_3$ is suppressed by a factor of 4360, leading to a $^{94}$Mo/$^{93}$Nb interference of $1.28\\,\\times\\,10^{-10}$ in the same targets. For $^{93}$Mo measurements, MoO$_2^-$ is selected, with interference from $^{93}$NbO$_2^-$ suppressed by 637\\,nm photons by a factor of $5.5\\,\\times\\,10^6$. This results in a $^{93}$Nb/$^\\text{nat}$Mo level of $1.3\\,\\times\\,10^{-13}$ in targets prepared from commercial MoO$_3$. Suppression factors as high as this are not achieved by isobar suppression techniques based on differences in energy loss, not even by AMS facilities with terminal voltages above 8.5\\,MV.",

    "title": "Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical   Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks",
    "abstract": "Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.",

We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.",

    "abstract": "We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.",

Additive-free, electroformed copper, in addition to a set of advantages, exhibits exceptional radiopurity, making it the material of choice for rare-event searches.

Early investigations explored the synthesis of these alloys by electrodeposition and thermal processing. A materials-design approach is proposed to optimize the fabrication and thermal processing stages of manufacturing. It is assisted by materials modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of alloy compositions, which enables faster development of novel materials by predicting properties and materials performance. This approach is demonstrated by comparing simulations with previously reported experimental investigations and proposing improved thermal processing.",

    "abstract": "A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.",

    "title": "Disentangling Core and Edge Mechanisms of the Density Limit in DIII-D   Negative Triangularity Plasmas",
    "abstract": "The density limit is investigated in the DIII-D negative triangularity (NT) plasmas which lack a standard H-mode edge. We find the limit may not be a singular disruptive boundary but a multifaceted density saturation phenomenon governed by distinct core and edge transport mechanisms. Sustained, non-disruptive operation is achieved at densities up to 1.8 times the Greenwald limit ($n_\\mathrm{G}$) until the termination of auxiliary heating. Systematic power scans reveal distinct power scalings for the core ($n_e \\propto P_\\mathrm{SOL}^{0.27\\pm0.03}$) and edge ($n_e \\propto P_\\mathrm{SOL}^{0.42\\pm0.04}$) density limits. The edge density saturation is triggered abruptly by the onset of a non-disruptive, high-field side radiative instability that clamps the edge density below $n_\\mathrm{G}$. In contrast, the core density continues to rise until it saturates, a state characterized by substantially enhanced core turbulence. Core transport evolves from a diffusive to an intermittent, avalanche-like state, as indicated by heavy-tailed probability density functions (kurtosis $\\approx 6$), elevated Hurst exponents, and a $1/f$-type power spectrum. These findings suggest that the density limit in the low-confinement regime is determined by a combination of edge radiative instabilities and core turbulent transport. This distinction provides separate targets for control strategies aimed at extending the operational space of future fusion devices.",

    "title": "Simulating Gadolinium-Induced Magnetic Field Variations for Temperature   Sensing with Magneto-Mechanical Resonators",
    "abstract": "Small-size magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR) represent an emerging class of passive, wireless sensors that combine a sensing functionality with a tracking option. The operation principle is based on a resonating rotor oscillation whose frequency is defined by the magnetic flux density of a stator magnet. One general sensing mechanism is the coupling of an external parameter to this resonator frequency. In this study, we investigate an approach for encoding a temperature information as a shift in the natural oscillation frequency utilizing the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of gadolinium (Gd). We perform an isolated simulation study on the temperature scaling of the magnetic field generation for stators coated with Gd of varying thickness. Our results show that the magnetic phase transition of Gd at its Curie temperature leads to a pronounced change in the magnetic permeability enabling a significant magnetic shielding behavior only for lower temperatures. In the transition regime, we find a peak sensitivity reaching 45.8 Hz/K exceeding existing values from the literature by up to a factor of $\\sim$ 20. The findings of this work are an important step toward quantitative high-sensitivity temperature extraction with MMRs.",

    "title": "Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime   experiment $τ$SPECT",
    "abstract": "The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).   UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\\,\\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.   The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.",

    "title": "An Evaluation of External Magnetic Flux Error in Magnet-Moving Kibble   balances",
    "abstract": "The magnet-moving measurement scheme in Kibble balances avoids displacing force-sensitive components, such as the weighing cell, and enables a broader magnetic profile measurement range during the velocity phase. However, this mechanism introduces the risk of asymmetry in the $Bl$ measurement due to external magnetic flux, leading to a potential systematic error in the final measurement results. Using the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance magnet as a case study, this paper investigates the error mechanism through finite element analysis and experimental investigations. An evaluation method combining external weak-field measurements with attenuation factor analysis is proposed to assess external magnetic flux errors in magnet-moving measurement schemes. The findings demonstrate that selecting an optimal weighing position can reduce the far-end flux effect to the order of $10^{-9}$. In contrast, the near-end flux effect can be quantified by monitoring the magnetic field surrounding the magnet system. In the Tsinghua Kibble balance system, we show that with proper control of external flux sources, the relative error can be reduced below $1 \\times 10^{-8}$ without requiring additional magnetic shielding.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\\approx 3\\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.",

The method takes advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational independence of background contributions.

However, achieving coherent radiation from such interactions needs to precisely control the phase matching of the radiationg electrons, which has proven to be exceptionally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that coherent attosecond radiation can be produced when a laser pulse interacts at grazing angle with a relativistic electron beam. The electrons oscillate in the laser field and are modulated with a superluminal phase, coherent ultrashort pulse trains are produced in the far field at the Cherenkov angle. This is verified by theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, including three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and far-field time-domain radiation simulations.

    "title": "Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons   Performance",
    "abstract": "There is a growing realization that neutrinos can be used as a diagnostic tool to better understand the inner workings of a nuclear weapon. Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Dynamically compressed materials in longitudinal waves are described by two physical models: hydrostatic pressure, with equal, normal, principal stresses or material uniaxially strained in the wave propagation direction. These models are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important. Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are 0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the respective materials. Crystal structure transformations with homogeneous pressurized stresses, mandating equal normal strains, should not be anticipated to agree with heterogeneous, uniaxially strained and sheared crystalline phases. Measurements support in-plane strains increasing with pressure, p, in fcc and hcp aluminum as with p in GPa.",

Thanks to its high mechanical strength, low density, machinability, and commercial availability in relatively radio-pure forms, titanium is a suitable material for structural elements in rare event searches. To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical etching stage is usually performed. However, the chemical resistance of titanium means that, conventionally, such etching is done with hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such hazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground laboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is presented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\\mu$m of material from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface contaminants after etching.

Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\\alpha\\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which tends to go at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.",

    "title": "Automated simulation-based design via multi-fidelity active learning and   optimisation for laser direct drive implosions",
    "abstract": "The design of inertial fusion experiments is a complex task as driver energy must be delivered in a precise manner to a structured target to achieve a fast, but hydrodynamically stable, implosion. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulation codes are an essential tool in this design process. However, multi-dimensional simulations that capture hydrodynamic instabilities are more computationally expensive than optimistic, 1D, spherically symmetric simulations which are often the primary design tool. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that aims to effectively use information from a large number of 1D simulations to inform design in the presence of hydrodynamic instabilities. We use an ensemble of neural network surrogate models trained on both 1D and 2D data to capture the space of good designs, i.e. those that are robust to hydrodynamic instabilities. We use this surrogate to perform Bayesian optimisation to find optimal designs for a 25 kJ laser driver. We perform hydrodynamic scaling on these designs to confirm the achievement of high gain for a 2 MJ laser driver, using 2D simulations including alpha heating effects.",

    "title": "HEART: A New X-Ray Tracing Code for Mosaic Crystal Spectrometers",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new open-source Python x-ray tracing code for modelling Bragg diffracting mosaic crystal spectrometers: High Energy Applications Ray Tracer (HEART). HEART's high modularity enables customizable workflows as well as efficient development of novel features. Utilizing Numba's just-in-time (JIT) compiler and the message-passing interface (MPI) allows running HEART in parallel leading to excellent performance. HEART is intended to be used for modelling x-ray spectra as they would be seen in experiments that measure x-ray spectroscopy with a mosaic crystal spectrometer. This enables the user to make predictions about what will be seen on a detector in experiment, perform optimizations on the design of the spectrometer setup, or to study the effect of the spectrometer on measured spectra. However, the code certainly has further uses beyond these example use cases. Here, we discuss the physical model used in the code, and explore a number of different mosaic distribution functions, intrinsic rocking curves, and sampling approaches which are available to the user. Finally, we demonstrate its strong predictive capability in comparison to spectroscopic data collected at the European XFEL in Germany.",

    "title": "A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for   correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon   counting detectors",
    "abstract": "A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.",

    "title": "Dipole Localization Using An Integrated Radio Frequency Atomic   Magnetometer",
    "abstract": "Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.",

This system ran successfully, interfacing with Jefferson Lab's full EPICS network, and we offer it as an example of the capabilities of pythonSoftIOC to build lightweight, yet robust and flexible instrumentation platforms that would be easily adapted for use at a small-scale laboratory.

    "abstract": "Standard approaches to neoclassical theory do not extend into regions of strong gradients in tokamaks such as the pedestal and internal transport barriers. Here, we calculate the modifications to neoclassical electron physics inside strong gradient regions of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that these modifications are due to the different ion flow and the strong poloidal variation of the potential. We also provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms that drive poloidal asymmetries and hence a poloidal electric field. We apply our model to two specific example cases of pedestal profiles, calculating the neoclassical electron flux and the bootstrap current. We find that depending on the ion flow, weak gradient neoclassical theory overestimates or underestimates the neoclassical electron transport and the bootstrap current in regions with strong gradients. We show that the determination of the mean parallel flow is more complex than in weak gradient neoclassical theory. For vanishing turbulence, we can determine the radial electric field for a given flow profile in the pedestal.",

We present an energy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct compact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform pattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates outstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly 100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based photon identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.",

Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.",

    "title": "Impact of angle-dependent recombination on neutrino energy   reconstruction in LArTPCs",
    "abstract": "The technology of Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chambers (LArTPC) plays a very important role in modern neutrino physics. It allows precise tracking and calorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important component of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion recombination effect. Existing experiments have provided constraints to its empirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle with respect to the TPC's electric field.   In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the predictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable uncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$ typical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome unphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate the consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy responses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino energies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without angular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\\% at 0.5 GeV and -0.6\\% at 5 GeV. While small, these values are close to the typical requirement of 2\\% for the energy scale uncertainty of future experiments, and indicate the need to obtain actual experimental constraints at low $dE/dx$ and take the effect into account in order to achieve the best precision in future LAr TPC electron neutrino calorimetry.",

    "title": "Terahertz control of relativistic electron beams for femtosecond   bunching and laser-synchronized temporal locking",
    "abstract": "Femtosecond relativistic electron bunches and micro-bunch trains synchronised with femtosecond precision to external laser sources are widely sought for next-generation accelerator and photonic technologies, from extreme UV and X-ray light sources for materials science, to ultrafast electron diffraction and future high-energy physics colliders. While few-femtosecond bunches have been demonstrated, achieving the control, stability and femtosecond-level laser synchronisation remains critically out of reach. Here we demonstrate a concept for laser-driven compression of high-energy (35.5 MeV) electron bunches with temporal synchronisation to a high-power (few-TW) laser system. Laser-generated multi-cycle terahertz (THz) pulses drive periodic electron energy modulation, enabling subsequent magnetic compression capable of generating tuneable picosecond-spaced bunch trains with 30 pC total charge and 50 A peak currents, or to compress a single bunch by a factor of 27 down to 15 fs duration. The THz-driven compression simultaneously drives temporal-locking of the bunch to the THz drive laser, providing a route to femtosecond-level synchronisation, overcoming the timing jitter inherent to radio-frequency accelerators and high-power laser systems. This THz technique offers compact and flexible bunch control with unprecedented temporal synchronisation, opening a pathway to unlock new capabilities for free electron lasers, ultrafast electron diffraction and novel plasma accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial <1.3\\,J, <25\\,fs pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts, considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity. This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.",

Since the velocity of the interacting electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an appropriate sampling scheme is available.

    "abstract": "Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures data across multiple spectral bands, offering enhanced informational depth compared to standard RGB imaging and benefiting diverse fields such as agriculture, medical diagnostics, and industrial inspection. Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions. Moreover, data-driven MSI methods depend heavily on large, labeled training datasets and struggle with generalization. In this work, we present a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral sensor for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with the input of raw measurements from the multispectral sensor. Our proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10%. We also experimentally validate its performance under varying sampling rate conditions, by comparing it with conventional compressive sensing algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this technique to an MSI-based image segmentation task, in which spatial regions are discriminated according to their characteristic spectral signatures. This compact, high-fidelity, and portable approach offers promising pathways to lightweight and cost-effective spectral imaging on mobile platforms.",

    "title": "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2025 Proceedings",
    "abstract": "The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\\nu$DM'25) meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the MD$\\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could reveal.",

Chambers and electrodes are fabricated in the interconnect layers of a 65 nm CMOS chip through post-processing, enabling picoliter-volumes to be processed and imaged.

    "title": "On the Regulation of the Solar Wind Helium Abundance by the Hydrogen   Compressibility",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind speed ($v_\\mathrm{sw}$) is $\\sim0$ and $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\\sim50\\%$ of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large, $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\\sim50\\%$ value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches 1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that $\\nabla_{v_\\mathrm{sw}} \\! A_\\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases with decreasing $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$. We show that these large gradients are due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar wind's compressibility ($\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$), there are two subsets of enhanced $A_\\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\\'en wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely analogous to the Alfv\\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ quantile, $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right| \\lesssim 0.65$, an upper bound on non-Alfv\\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right| \\lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$ quantile, is an upper bound on incompressible fluctuations. We conclude that $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ is essential for characterizing the solar wind helium abundance and possibly regulating it.",

    "title": "Efficient ion re-acceleration in laboratory-produced interpenetrating   collisionless shocks",
    "abstract": "Although the origin of cosmic rays (CRs) remains an open question, collisionless magnetized shock waves are widely regarded as key sites for particle acceleration. Recent theories further suggest that shock-shock collisions in stellar clusters could provide the additional acceleration needed to explain the observed high-energy CR spectrum. Here, we investigate this hypothesis through a laser-based experiment that creates magnetized plasma conditions similar to astrophysical environments. Our results demonstrate that interpenetrating collisionless shocks can significantly boost the energy of ambient protons previously energized by the individual shocks, while also improving the overall acceleration efficiency. Numerical kinetic simulations corroborate these findings, revealing that protons are reaccelerated via their bouncing motion in the convective electric fields of the colliding magnetized flows. By allowing to highly energize ambient protons, our novel colliding-shock platform opens the prospect to test the long-discussed mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting.",

    "title": "ParaFlow: fast calorimeter simulations parameterized in upstream   material configurations",
    "abstract": "We study whether machine-learning models for fast calorimeter simulations can learn meaningful representations of calorimeter signatures that account for variations in the full particle detector's configuration. This may open new opportunities in high-energy physics measurements, for example in the assessment of systematic uncertainties that are related to the detector geometry, in the inference of properties of the detector configuration, or in the automated design of experiments. As a concrete example, we parameterize normalizing-flow-based simulations in configurations of the material upstream of a toy calorimeter. We call this model ParaFlow, which is trained to interpolate between different material budgets and positions, as simulated with Geant4. We study ParaFlow's performance in terms of photon shower shapes that are directly influenced by the properties of the upstream material, in which photons can convert to an electron-positron pair. In general, we find that ParaFlow is able to reproduce the dependence of the shower shapes on the material properties at the few-percent level with larger differences only in the tails of the distributions.",

    "title": "Multi-channel, multi-template event reconstruction for SuperCDMS data   using machine learning",
    "abstract": "SuperCDMS SNOLAB uses kilogram-scale germanium and silicon detectors to search for dark matter. Each detector has Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) patterned on the top and bottom faces of a large crystal substrate, with the TESs electrically grouped into six phonon readout channels per face. Noise correlations are expected among a detector's readout channels, in part because the channels and their readout electronics are located in close proximity to one another. Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy deposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on their location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in the readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy resolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the experiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse reconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise and pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a superposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\\times$M filter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal component analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\\times$M and GBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while improving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic events by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture peak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $<$ 50 eV from the previously published value of $\\sim$100 eV. These results lay the groundwork for position reconstruction in SuperCDMS with the N$\\times$M outputs.",

    "abstract": "The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at higher laser loads will benefit from further dedicated cryogenic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency, the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and the spill quality. Experiments confirm these observations while highlighting the reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for knock out extraction systems.",
