  "title": "Design of high-strength, radiopure copper-chromium alloys for rare-event   searches assisted by computational thermodynamics",
  "abstract": "Direct Dark Matter detection and studies on the nature of neutrinos demand detector systems with extremely low background levels, including from radioactivity. Additive-free, electroformed copper, in addition to a set of advantages, exhibits exceptional radiopurity, making it the material of choice for rare-event searches. To satisfy the increasing demand for materials with superior mechanical strength, the development of copper-chromium alloys is pursued. Early investigations explored the synthesis of these alloys by electrodeposition and thermal processing. A materials-design approach is proposed to optimize the fabrication and thermal processing stages of manufacturing. It is assisted by materials modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of alloy compositions, which enables faster development of novel materials by predicting properties and materials performance. This approach is demonstrated by comparing simulations with previously reported experimental investigations and proposing improved thermal processing.",
