  "title": "Beam-Beam Fields with Full Six-Dimensional Coupling: Theory and   Computational Methods",
  "abstract": "This work presents a generalized theoretical framework for calculating beam-beam fields induced by a Gaussian beam with full six-dimensional coupling. We also develop computational techniques for evaluating these fields. A case study based on the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) electron storage ring illustrates the practical application of the framework. Our results suggest that the standard slice model for the beam-beam kick can significantly underestimate the longitudinal field. The proposed theory may provide a foundation for developing improved simulation models and guiding future design studies.",
