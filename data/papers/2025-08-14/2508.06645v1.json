  "title": "AI-driven neutrino diagnostics and radiation-hard beam instrumentation   for next-generation neutrino experiments",
  "abstract": "The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deliver a high-intensity, multi-megawatt neutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), enabling precision tests of the three-neutrino paradigm, CP violation searches, neutrino mass ordering determination, and supernova neutrino studies. In order to accelerate DUNE's physics reach and ensure robust beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. A physics-informed digital twin is at the heart of this Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor. By reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be reduced from 5\\% to 1\\%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US-Japan R\\&D effort will deploy a LGAD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. Time of Flight (ToF) measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects. Simulations confirm strong responses to these effects. Machine learning models can predict beam quality and horn current with sub-percent accuracy. This scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity and reduces systematics, transforming high-power accelerator operations.",
