  "title": "Einstein Telescope: Ferromagnetic Shielding for Magnetic Noise   Mitigation",
  "abstract": "The Einstein Telescope is the next-generation gravitational wave interferometer which, compared to current detectors, will enable the observation of gravitational signals at lower frequencies with a sensitivity improved by approximately two orders of magnitude. Achieving such exceptional sensitivity requires minimizing all sources of noise. In the low-frequency regime, magnetic noise is one of the dominant. This article examines the effectiveness and limitations of a passive mitigation technique: ferromagnetic shielding.",
