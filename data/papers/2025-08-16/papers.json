    "title": "Double-Corrugated Degenerate Band-Edge Oscillator Driven by an Electron   Beam",
    "abstract": "The properties of a degenerate band-edge (DBE) oscillator based on the synchronous interaction between a linear electron beam synchronized with four degenerate electromagnetic modes are presented. The DBE in the cold slow-wave structure is implemented in a rectangular waveguide with a staggered double corrugation in it. At the DBE, four modes coalesce into a single degenerate mode, forming a very flat dispersion diagram with vanishing or very small group velocity. The DBE oscillator frequency is robust to variations in electron beam current, electrons' velocity, and cavity length. The DBE oscillator concept provided here is expected to be extendable to several other geometries as long as the slow wave structure supports a DBE.",

    "title": "Energy Bunching from Sub-Cycle Ionization Injection in Laser Wakefield   Acceleration",
    "abstract": "We report the first experimental observation of carrier-envelope phase-driven energy bunching in laser wakefield acceleration. Using a few-cycle (~9 fs), multi-terawatt laser pulse and ionization injection in a helium-nitrogen gas mixture, we observe electron spectra composed of multiple quasi-monoenergetic peaks with regular narrow energy spacing. This comb structure arises from intermittent injection from successive half-cycles of the laser field, enabled by the evolving carrier-envelope phase during propagation in the plasma. These findings establish sub-cycle ionization injection as a potential route to attosecond control in plasma acceleration, enabling injection and beam structuring synchronized to the optical waveform on sub-femtosecond timescales.",

    "title": "Towards controlling electron charge with nanoparticle assisted laser   wakefield accelerators",
    "abstract": "This study explores nanoparticle-assisted electron injection as a method for controlling beam charge in laser wakefield acceleration through particle-in-cell simulations. We systematically investigate how the material (Li through Au) and size (50-200 nm) of nanoparticles influence electron injection dynamics and beam charge. Our results demonstrate that beam charge (10-600 pC) can be effectively controlled by adjusting these parameters. We identify a saturation threshold in the nanoparticle electric field strength, beyond which beam charge depends on the total number of atoms in the nanoparticle rather than on the electron density after ionization. Significant electron injection occurs across multiple plasma wave periods with distribution patterns influenced by nanoparticle properties leading to increased beam charge but a broader energy spread. These findings offer practical guidelines for experimental implementation of nanoparticle-assisted injection in laser wakefield accelerators to tailor electron beam characteristics for various applications.",

    "title": "Probing ultrafast heating and ionization dynamics in solid density   plasmas with time-resolved resonant X-ray absorption and emission",
    "abstract": "Heating and ionization are among the most fundamental processes in ultra-short, relativistic laser-solid interactions. However, capturing their spatiotemporal evolution experimentally is challenging due to the inherently transient and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) nature. Here, time-resolved resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy, in conjunction with simultaneous X-ray absorption imaging, is employed to investigate such complex dynamics in a thin copper wire driven by an optical high-intensity laser pulse, with sub-picosecond temporal resolution. The diagnostic leverages the high brightness and narrow spectral bandwidth of an X-ray free-electron laser, to selectively excite resonant transitions of highly charged ions within the hot dense plasma generated by the optical laser. The measurements reveal a distinct rise-and-fall temporal evolution of the resonant X-ray emission yield-and consequently the selected ion population-over a 10 ps timescale, accompanied by an inversely correlated x-ray transmission. In addition, off-resonance emissions with comparable yields on both sides of the XFEL photon energy are clearly observed, indicating balanced ionization and recombination rates. Furthermore, experimental results are compared with comprehensive simulations using atomic collisional-radiative models, PIC, and MHD codes to elucidate the underlying physics. The comparison reveals that typical models overestimate the plasma heating under the extreme conditions achieved in our experiment, highlighting the requirement for improved modeling of NLTE collisional processes for predictive capabilities. These results are of broad interest to the high-energy-density science and inertial fusion energy research, both as an experimental platform for accessing theoretically challenging conditions and as a benchmark for improving models of high-power laser-plasma interactions.",

    "abstract": "Superfluid helium-3 bolometers can be utilised for dark matter direct detection searches. The extremely low heat capacity of the B phase of the superfluid helium-3 at ultra-low temperatures offers the potential to reach world leading sensitivity to spin dependent interactions of dark matter in the sub-GeV/c$^2$ mass range. Here, we describe the development of bolometry using both micron scale and sub-micron diameter vibrating wire resonators, with a SQUID amplifier-based readout scheme. Characterisation of the resonators and bolometer measurements are shown, including the use of non-linear operation and the corresponding corrections. The bolometer contains two vibrating wire resonators, enabling heat injection calibration and simultaneous bolometer tracking measurements. Coincident events measured on both vibrating wire resonators verify their response. We also demonstrate proof of concept frequency multiplexed readout. Development of these measurement techniques lays the foundations for the use of superfluid helium-3 bolometers, instrumented with vibrating nano-mechanical resonators, for future low threshold dark matter searches.",

    "abstract": "With the aid of COMSOL multiphysics simulations, a compact microwave plasma reactor operated at 2.45 GHz frequency has been designed for diamond film deposition. The reactor consists of a cylindrical cavity that resonates in the fundamental mode $TM_{01p}$ with a longitudinal field variation (p = 1). Investigations on microwave electric field and hydrogen $(H_{2})$ plasma characteristics inside the microwave plasma cavity have been carried out, which assisted in the resonant cavity optimizations. The new reactor design includes a unique antenna structure which facilitates better thermal management and gas inlet arrangement. Parametric analysis of the effect of increase in microwave power, gas pressure and synergistic effects of power and pressure variations on the $H_{2}$ plasma characteristics such as electron density, gas temperature, and atomic hydrogen density have been performed computationally to estimate the optimize reactor operating conditions. Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively. Preliminary experimental validation which includes vacuum integrity and $H_{2}$ plasma ignition tests inside the cavity are also reported.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interaction between turbulence and zonal flows is critical for modeling turbulence transport in fusion plasmas, often described through predator-prey dynamics. However, traditional deterministic models like the Lotka-Volterra equations simplify this interaction and fail to capture the small fluctuations in simulation data. In this study, we develop a neural network model based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to represent the predator-prey dynamics using limited data from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system. We extract the drift and diffusion terms via neural networks, incorporating physical constraints and employing the unscented transform to mitigate challenges brought by limited data. The model accurately reproduces key dynamical features, including stagnation phenomena and energy exchange mechanisms, and the state density distribution generated from the model shows a low KL divergence with the simulation data. A parameter scan reveals that zonal flow shearing efficiency decreases with amplitude, and predator-prey oscillations damp in the absence of stochasticity. These findings underscore the value of integrating physical insight into data-driven approaches for complex plasma systems.",

    "title": "Measurements and TCAD simulations of innovative RSD and DC-RSD LGAD   devices for future 4D tracking",
    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the beam test results obtained with a Resistive Silicon Detector (RSD) (also called AC-Low Gain Avalanche Diode, AC-LGAD) pixel array tested at the DESY beam test facility with a 5 GeV/c electron beam. Furthermore, it describes in detail the simulation results of DC-RSD, an evolution of the RSD design. The simulations campaign described in this paper has been instrumental in the definition of the structures implemented in the Fondazione Bruno Kessler FBK first DC-RSD production.   The RSD matrix used in this study is part of the second FBK RSD production, RSD2. The best position resolution reached in this test is sigma_x = 15 micron, about 3.4% of the pitch. DC-RSD LGAD, are an evolution of the AC-coupled design, eliminating the dielectric and using a DC-coupling to the electronics. The concept of DC-RSD has been finalized using full 3D Technology-CAD simulations of the sensor behavior. TCAD simulations are an excellent tool for designing this innovative class of detectors, enabling the evaluation of different technology options (e.g., the resistivity of the n+ layer, contact materials) and geometrical layouts (shape and distance of the read-out pads).",

The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux.

    "abstract": "The Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a platform that seeks to achieve fusion via a concept known as Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion (PJMIF). The experiment consists of three main phases: (1) target formation in which up to four plasma guns shoot magnetized hydrogen or deuterium-tritium jets to form a quasi-spherical target, (2) liner formation in which a constellation of 36 guns fire high-atomic number (e.g., xenon) jets to form a liner shell, and (3) target compression in which the formed liner implodes the pre-formed target. Each phase of the PLX probes different plasma regimes with different physics at play, thus we simulated each phase separately and with multiple codes. Here we highlight some of the 1D, 2D, and 3D simulation results of all three phases from the FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS codes. Some of the key physical processes involved include shock dynamics, kinetic effects, anisotropic thermal conduction, resistive magnetic diffusion, radiation transport, and magnetized jet dynamics. Our simulations show that the PLX can form a preheated (~40 eV), magnetized (electron Hall parameter >1) target plasma, and a quasi-collisional liner shell that can subsequently compress the target to fusion-relevant conditions (e.g., temperatures >1 keV).",

    "title": "Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of   positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization",
    "abstract": "The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.",

    "title": "Absolute constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power   plants",
    "abstract": "Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power, the required time between fusion pulses, and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by a simple evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The evolution equation suggests methods of avoiding the limitations of these constraints. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is proceeding on a fast timescale to operate a fusion power plant -- even writing contracts on the power to be produced by their ARC tokamak. This makes it important to determine the issues that should be studied by SPARC, which is the tokamak that CFS is building to address issues before ARC is built. The STEP prototype of a spherical tokamak power plant in the United Kingdom is on a similar fast timescale. Feasible simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance. This paper has two purposes: (1) Illustrate issues on which research must be focused for the credibility tokamak power plants. (2) Encourage thought on the allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.",

    "abstract": "Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.",

    "title": "Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic   Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events",
    "abstract": "The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.",

It features an active target of 5.9 tonnes of cryogenic liquid xenon (8.5 tonnes total mass in cryostat). The experiment is expected to extend the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter by more than an order of magnitude compared to XENON1T, thanks to the larger active mass and the significantly reduced background, improved by novel systems such as a radon removal plant and a neutron veto.

    "abstract": "A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\\\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward positive lightning pulses and the \"Classical\" and \"Narrow\" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.",

Bang, {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 055002 (2013).] using the Texas Petawatt laser beam. The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the kinetic effects of upstream, magnetic field-aligned, flow shear on anti-parallel magnetic reconnection using 2.5D Particle-In-Cell simulations. Our results demonstrate that flow shear significantly alters the reconnection process, leading to enhanced ion heating, reduced outflow speeds, and a modified reconnection geometry. In contrast to previous Hall Magnetohydrodynaic (MHD) studies, we find that reconnection becomes a more efficient plasma heating mechanism in the presence of sub-Alfv\\'enic flow shear, with ion heating increasing by as much as 300\\%. This enhanced heating is achieved by efficiently converting the incoming flow shear energy into thermal energy through istropization in the exhaust. The enhanced heating leads to a pressure gradient away form the x-line exerting a force that reduces the outflow jet speed and slows down the reconnection process. This conversion is due to beam selection effects, mixing and scattering in the exhaust. A theoretical model is developed which predicts well the exhaust heating and outflow speed reduction. These results offer a potential explanation for recent Parker Solar Probe observations of suppressed reconnection in the presence of flow shear and carry significant implications for energy dissipation in turbulent plasmas.",

    "abstract": "The construction of the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been completed, with current efforts focused on subsystem commissioning. Beam commissioning is scheduled for autumn 2025, marking a critical milestone in the HIAF project. This paper presents high-precision optics calculations for the Booster Ring (BRing) of HIAF, a key component for achieving stable heavy-ion beam acceleration. Leveraging high-precision magnetic field data, each magnet is divided into hundreds of slices, thus establishing a high-precision sliced optics model for BRing. Detailed calculations of BRing's optics are presented in this work. Critical parameters including tunes and betatron functions of the lattice based on the measured magnetic fields and those of the ideal lattice have been compared. The results highlight the impact of realistic magnetic field on beam dynamics and provide essential insights for accelerator tuning and optimization. These findings serve as a fundamental reference for beam commissioning and long-term operation, ensuring beam stability and performance reproducibility in HIAF.",

    "abstract": "The temporal resolution of MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is fundamentally constrained by the electron bunch length at the sample, motivating the development of new electron sources capable of producing femtosecond scale bunches. In this work, we propose a multicell RF photogun that has a tailored phase velocity profile to generate 5 to 15 fs rms MeV electron bunches directly from the electron gun, eliminating the need for downstream compression. This approach achieves comparable performance to conventional one and a half cell photoguns with downstream compression, while reducing system size, complexity, and power requirements. We examine two implementations: a standing wave (SW) and a travelling wave (TW) design. The TW variant demonstrates over an order of magnitude lower power dissipation than typical SW structures, enabling potential kHz operation. When paired with SwissFEL style C band RF sources, which offer high amplitude and phase stability, the TW photogun is projected to deliver a temporal resolution of 26 fs rms.",

    "title": "On the stability analysis of astrophysical cooling functions",
    "abstract": "To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.",

    "title": "Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the   Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging",
    "abstract": "This paper formally defines optogeometric factor as a pixel level measure of geometric optical throughput.   The quantity is formally defined as the surface solid angle integral of the local etendue between a pixel and its corresponding scene element. Under ideal geometric optical conditions, it can be approximated by the product of the projected pixel footprint area on the object plane and the solid angle covered by the entrance pupil. Provides a compact link between the radiance of the scene and the radiant flux collected by a single pixel, making explicit the spatial angular coupling that governs the radiometric measurements at the pixel level.   Two mathematically equivalent expressions of optogeometric factor are derived: a scene based form, expressed via the footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed via the pixel pitch and optical f number. Their equivalence is demonstrated analytically and confirmed using representative parameters of real thermal imaging systems.   The concept is extended to effective optogeometric factor, which incorporates the pixel fill factor to account for the active area of the sensor. This concept enables a clear separation of geometric optical coupling from detector design and other calibration terms, offering a physically transparent and transferable basis for quantitative thermography and other imaging modalities operating in the geometric optics regime.",

    "abstract": "Stellarator optimization often takes a two-stage approach, where in the first stage the boundary is varied in order to optimize for some physics metrics, while in the second stage the boundary is kept fixed and coils are sought to generate a magnetic field that can recreate the desired stellarator. Past literature dealing with this stage lacks details on the coil cutting procedure and the mathematical and physical properties of the surface current potential which dictates it. In this work, some basic physical quantities of the surface current and how they relate to the parameters in the current potential are presented, and supported for the first time by explicit mathematical derivations. Additionally, the details of how to account for the presence of an external field in the surface current algorithm are explicitly presented. These relations underpin the procedure of discretizing the surface current into coils. Finally, the conventionally-used algorithm for discretizing the surface current into coils is detailed, along with an example coil optimization for both a modular and a helical coilset. The algorithm is implemented in the \\texttt{DESC} code, with both modular and helical coil capabilities, where it is available for use in stellarator coil design.",

Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured z-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS alone, i.e. without the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. This approach, which is both precise and accurate, corroborates previous numerical simulations and is expected to improve the overall reconstruction accuracy of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors including higher order spatial modes.",

We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.",

    "abstract": "We consider a magnetised plasma in contact with an absorbing planar wall, where the angle $\\alpha$ between the magnetic field and the wall is small, $\\alpha \\ll 1$ (in radians) and the system is symmetric tangential to the wall. The finite ratio $\\gamma$ of the characteristic electron gyroradius $\\rho_{\\rm e}$ to the Debye length $\\lambda_{\\rm D}$, $\\gamma = \\rho_{\\rm e} / \\lambda_{\\rm D}$, is retained via a grazing-incidence ($\\alpha \\ll 1$) gyrokinetic treatment [1,2]. Building on a previously developed iterative scheme [2,3] to solve for the steady-state electrostatic potential in the quasineutral magnetic presheath of width $\\sim \\rho_{\\rm S}$, we developed a scheme that simultaneously solves for both the presheath and the non-neutral Debye sheath of width $\\sim \\lambda_{\\rm D}$ in the limit $\\lambda_{\\rm D} / \\rho_{\\rm S} \\rightarrow 0$. The code, called GYRAZE, thus provides the energy-angle distribution of ions at the wall and the velocity distributions of electrons reflected by the wall for different values of wall potential. A monotonic electrostatic potential profile, assumed in this work, can only exist for magnetic field angles larger than a critical value [3]. While the critical angle is shown here to significantly increase with $\\gamma$, it is still typically smaller than the magnetic field angle at divertor targets of a fusion device.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.",

    "abstract": "Due to advances in equipment and intense research on plasma biomedical applications over the past few years, plasma devices are now suitable for clinical use. It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be designed in a way that ensures their safe operation and application whilst preserving the relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of such plasma devices remain high, which can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a low-cost plasma jet configuration is proposed in order to evaluate the device's viability for medical applications using argon as working gas. Typically, plasma jets operating with argon (Ar) generate high electrical currents, which makes them unsuitable for medical applications. With the proposed device modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Tests on water activation by plasma jets with and without the proposed modification indicate that both devices can yield comparable outcomes.",

It consists of six electrode pairs that form a nearly energy-isochronous potential and a pulsed drift-tube to trap the ions between the electrodes. Time-of-flight peak widths down to 22 ns full-width at half-maximum and mass-resolving powers of $\\approx 1.5 \\times 10^5$ within 20 ms have been demonstrated. The obtained time-focus and mass-resolving power depend sensitively on the trapping energy, energy spread and the number of revolutions of the ions. The mass-resolving power is affected by the temporal and energy spread of the ions entering the MR-ToF-MS, and fluctuations in the electrode voltages due to temperature variations. The longitudinal emittance corresponding to the temporal and energy spread of $^{39}$K is estimated to be 175 eVns based on the data, close to the expected 186(10) eVns. The time-of-flight temperature sensitivity is found to be -5.55(30) ppm/K. In addition to atomic mass measurements of short-lived exotic nuclides, the MR-ToF-MS can be used as a fast mass separator for various other experiments at IGISOL and as an ion counter for laser spectroscopy and yield measurements.",

    "abstract": "Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles. Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type. These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing mechanism.",

    "title": "Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas:   Implications for Particle Acceleration",
    "abstract": "While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\\sigma \\gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\\sigma < 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.",

The high-order (HO) system evolves particles in a manner that conserves charge, energy, and canonical momentum, while the low-order (LO) system solves the fluid moment and Darwin equations, acting as an algorithmic convergence accelerator to the HO system. We demonstrate the HOLO method's ability to take timesteps far larger than the explicit limit, and accurately recover the system's evolution so long as its dynamical timescale is respected. Also, we find that the choice of LO fluid moment equations has a strong impact on the nonlinear convergence of the coupled particle-field system. The HOLO algorithm is benchmarked against electrostatic Landau damping and the electromagnetic electron and ion Weibel instabilities.",

    "title": "Dark Count Rate Stability of JUNO 20-inch PMTs in Mass Testing",
    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an ambitious multipurpose neutrino experiment designed to determine the neutrino mass ordering, with an impressive energy resolution goal of at least 3% at 1 MeV. To achieve a photon detection coverage of approximately 75%, JUNO will utilize two types of 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs): the large PMT (LPMT) and the microchannel plate PMT (MCP-PMT). A significant concern in high-precision neutrino measurements is the dark count rate (DCR) of PMTs, which introduces noise that can adversely affect energy measurement accuracy. During the mass testing phase of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, comprehensive measurements of the DCR were undertaken. These measurements not only captured the DCR values of individual PMTs but also examined the stability and temperature dependence of the DCR at an operating gain of (1x10^7). This paper presents a detailed characterization of the DCR of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, investigating factors such as cooling time, temperature variations, and long-term stability using the JUNO Pan-Asia PMT testing facilities. The results reveal distinct DCR characteristics between the two types of PMTs, providing valuable insights into the nature of DCR and its implications for JUNO's scientific objectives. In addition to performance characterization, we implemented a monitoring system to track DCR stability over time. Notably, several spikes in DCR were identified, prompting a preliminary investigation into their causes. Potential factors contributing to these spikes, such as flasher events, were explored using coincidence rate analysis and complementary imaging techniques. The findings from this study are crucial for optimizing the performance of PMTs in JUNO, ultimately aiding the experiment in achieving its goals related to neutrino physics.",

    "abstract": "A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp time is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp times are less than the ramp times in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp times are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.",

We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4\\pi$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.",

However, a number of recent studies have showcased high-frequency and high-field amplitude AC magnetometry loop tracers capable of retrieving the magnetic AC hysteresis curve and the associated magnetic properties. In this paper, we present an easily constructable loop tracer that is retrofitted into an existing AC calorimetry setup. This enables the loop tracer to function simultaneously with the AC calorimetry setup and also to be run as a high-frequency AC susceptometer. The loop tracer is shown to work in the frequency range 160-922 kHz with maximum applied fields from 18 to 46 mT depending on the frequency. An iron oxide nanoflower sample is used to test the loop tracer, showcasing high reproducibility in measured magnetic parameters as well as quantitative agreement between the different measurement methods in the setup.",

    "abstract": "Inter-channel mis-synchronisation can be a limiting factor to the time resolution of high performance timing detectors with multiple readout channels and independent electronics units. In these systems, time calibration methods employed must be able to efficiently correct for minimal mis-synchronisation between channels and achieve the best detector performance. We present an iterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector systems with multiple readout channels. Starting from correlated hit pairs alone, and without requiring an external reference time measurement, the method solves for fixed per-channel offsets, with precision limited only by the intrinsic single-channel resolution. A mathematical proof that the method is able to find the correct time offsets to be assigned to each detector channel in order to achieve inter-channel synchronisation is given, and it is shown that the number of iterations to reach convergence within the desired precision is controllable with a single parameter. Numerical studies are used to confirm unbiased recovery of true offsets. Finally, the application of the calibration method to the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and the Time of Flight (TOF) detector at the upgraded T2K near detector (ND280) shows good improvement in overall timing resolution, demonstrating the effectiveness in a real-world scenario and scalability.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton",
    "abstract": "We confirm the existence of a new bulk medium quasiparticle with transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) and elucidate its physical origin. The tOAM structure is driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the medium, originating from the magnetic Lorentz force, even for weak light fields. There are two contributions to the material tOAM: one part depends on the pulse spatial shape change as it passes through an interface, and the other part depends on dispersion. The results, from first principles particle-in-cell simulations of a simple plasma, are in excellent agreement with our theory for general dielectric media [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. For plasma, there is agreement up to near-critical densities and near-relativistic field strengths.",

    "title": "Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition Regime: Spatially-Segregated Structure   of Compressive MHD Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{k}}/E_{\\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.",
