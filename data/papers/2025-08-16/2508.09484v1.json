  "title": "Exact expressions for nonperturbative guiding center theory in symmetric   fields",
  "abstract": "We apply a recently-developed nonperturbative guiding center formalism to charged particle dynamics in fields with two-parameter continuous symmetry groups. This entails finding exact constants of motion, valid in the nonperturbative regime, that agree with Kruskal's adiabatic invariant series to all orders in the perturbative regime, when the field scale length is large compared with a typical gyroradius. We demonstrate that the nonperturbative guiding center model makes exact predictions in these cases, even though it eliminates the cyclotron timescale, thereby establishing a theoretical baseline for performance of the nonperturbative formalism.",
