  "title": "Quantum measurement systems and applications to particle physics and   cosmology",
  "abstract": "There are new detector proposals and R&D that utilize quantum enhancements not previously adopted. Examples include superconducting quantum sensors, atom interferometry, and quantum spin sensors. They are mainly motivated by industrial applications toward quantum computing, secure quantum communication systems, and high-sensitivity sensors. Given the excellent potential of the new quantum measurement systems, there are also new proposals to apply them in particle physics and cosmology. In this review, I survey currently available and emerging quantum technologies and their applications. I then discuss future directions and new proposals for particle physics and cosmology.",
