  "title": "Dynamic control of laser driven electron acceleration in a photonic   structure using programmable optical pulses",
  "abstract": "Progress in optical techniques has made precision control of the phase profile in optical pulses common and accessible in scientific laboratories. Carefully shaping the field profile of a laser pulse can be used to master the dynamics of electrons traveling in photonic accelerating structures such as the ones obtained by precisely aligning two dielectric gratings. Here we show that by applying a liquid-crystal-mask to program the phase and amplitude of an infrared laser pulse in combination with a pulse front tilt scheme, it is possible to implement dynamic control on a laser accelerator. This results in a nearly limitless live tuning capability of the accelerator beam dynamics, allowing the demonstration software-based correction of structure and optical front imperfections, implementation of transverse focusing schemes, control of the energy and charge of the output beam, and ultimately optimization of the interaction length, leading to measured energy gains of up to 0.55 MeV.",
