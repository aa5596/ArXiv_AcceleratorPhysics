  "title": "Exploration of novel ICP using helicon antennas with zero magnetic field",
  "abstract": "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) attracts great attention from aspects of fundamental research and practical applications, and efficient power coupling is highly desirable for both of them. The present study explores a novel strategy for efficient ICP through using helicon antennas with zero external magnetic field. Specific research is devoted to the effects of antenna geometry (loop, half-helix, Boswell, Nagoya III), driving frequency (13.56-54.24 MHz) and radial density profile (Gaussian and parabolic) on power coupling. Findings reveal that: loop antenna yields higher power deposition efficiency than half-helix, Boswell, and Nagoya III antennas, driving frequency gives negligible effects, and parabolic density profile results in more efficient power coupling than Gaussian density profile especially in the radial direction, for the conditions employed here. Therefore, it is suggested that for this novel ICP strategy one should use loop antenna with parabolic density profile, and the industrial frequency of 13.56 MHz can work well. This study provides a valuable reference for the novel design of efficient ICP sources, which could be used for material processing and space propulsion, etc. Key words: Inductively coupled plasma; Antenna Geometry; Power Deposition; Driving Frequency",
