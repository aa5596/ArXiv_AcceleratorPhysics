  "title": "Simplified Analytical Models for Temperature-Dependent Characteristics   of Ultra-Fast Avalanche Detectors",
  "abstract": "Ultra-fast detectors have advanced the time resolution of semiconductor sensors to tens of picoseconds, while avalanche-type detectors, with internal gain, enable the detection of weak signals. In this work, we investigate the temperature dependence of ultra-fast avalanche detectors. Building on semiconductor theory and some empirical formulations, we establish a set of models to characterize key electrical properties and performance metrics such as gain and time resolution, and validate them through dedicated experiments. The results show good agreement between model predictions and experimental data, demonstrating the validity of the proposed models. This approach provides an efficient and physics-based method for rapid detector optimization and design.",
