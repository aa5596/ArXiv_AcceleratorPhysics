  "title": "Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments at the   RIBF",
  "abstract": "The advent of high-intensity radioactive ion beams has opened new avenues for nuclear structure research. By studying exotic ions, phenomena such as shell evolution, halos, and the limits of stability have been studied. In particular, Quasi-Free Scattering (QFS) experiments on hydrogen targets have proven to be a valuable tool to investigate the structure of exotic ions. Recently, a series of QFS experiments were performed at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) of the RIKEN Nishina Center employing the MINOS liquid hydrogen system. A fundamental part of the success of these experiments was the use of dedicated devices to measure the gamma-rays, charged particles, and neutrons emitted in the reactions. The experience gained during the past campaigns, as well as the upcoming upgrade of the RIBF facility call for improvements on the existing devices, as well as for the development of new detection systems. Here we review the main detection devices used at the RIBF for QFS experiments, and give an overview of the ongoing and upcoming developments.",
