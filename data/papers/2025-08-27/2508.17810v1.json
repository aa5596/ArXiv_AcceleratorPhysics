  "title": "Kinetic contribution to the arbitrary order odd frequency moments of the   dynamic structure factor",
  "abstract": "An exact expression is derived for the kinetic contribution to the odd (arbitrary order) frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor via a finite summation that features averages of even (all lower orders) powers of the momentum over the exact momentum distribution. The derivation is carried out for the non-interacting Fermi gas and generalized to the interacting case based on the conjecture that averages over the Fermi distribution can be substituted with averages over the exact distribution. The expression is validated against known results (first, third frequency moments) and new explicit calculations (fifth, seventh frequency moments).",
