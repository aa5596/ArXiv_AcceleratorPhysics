  "title": "QED cascade initiation via reflection of a multipetawatt laser pulse   from a self-organized parabolic plasma mirror",
  "abstract": "The self-sustained or avalanche-type cascade is an intriguing prediction of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) that has yet to be observed in laboratories. It is accompanied by the conversion of electromagnetic energy into gamma photons and electron-positron ($e^-e^+$) pairs, whose number increases exponentially over time. We investigate a simple configuration to initiate a QED cascades: it is based on the superposition of an incident multipetawatt laser pulse and its reflection from a solid target. The incident laser pulse <<deforms>> the initially flat target surface, creating a parabolic mirror that focuses the reflected radiation. For the considered setup the threshold laser power is about $7\\,\\text{PW}$. With a $27\\,\\text{PW}$ laser pulse, positron production exhibits clear signatures of an avalanche-type cascade, including exponential growth and more than 15 positron generations with similar energy spectra. Therefore, observing an avalanche-type QED cascade does not require the use of multiple laser channels with precise spatio-temporal synchronization, as previously supposed.",
