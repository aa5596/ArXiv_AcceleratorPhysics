  "title": "Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere",
  "abstract": "Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota & Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.",
