  "title": "Demonstration of a tandem lens for producing shaped laser-ionized   plasmas for plasma wakefield acceleration",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate a tandem lens optical setup, comprising two diffractive optics, that focuses a high-power ultrafast laser with a shaped on-axis intensity profile, producing a meter-long Bessel focus. The intended use of the optical setup is to produce a laser-ionized plasma source for plasma wakefield acceleration. By controlling the on-axis intensity, the density profile of the plasma ramps at the entrance and exit of the plasma can be tailored to optimize matching of the electron beam into the plasma. In addition to demonstrating the optical system, we describe the algorithm used to calculate the lens phases and present detailed calculations of the lenses' expected performance.",
