  "title": "AEgIS Experiment at CERN: Design and Commissioning of SARA (Scintillator   Assemblies to Reveal Annihilations)",
  "abstract": "SARA is the system of plastic scintillators coupled with silicon photomultipliers that will take part in the AEgIS experiment at CERN, measuring the time-of-flight of antihydrogen as it falls through a moir\\'e deflectometer. Its development focused on simplicity, versatility and economy of the design and was supported by both physical tests and finite elements numerical simulations. The instrument's structure pairs the utilization of the scintillators as structural components with custom made 3D printed corner elements and the electronics allows selection between coincidence discrimination made on each scintillator and made between different scintillators.",
