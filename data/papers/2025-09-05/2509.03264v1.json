  "title": "Universal Analytic Solution for the Quantum Transport of Structured   Matter-Waves in Magnetic Optics",
  "abstract": "We present a closed-form analytic solution for the propagation of an arbitrary charged scalar state in a non-uniform magnetic field. The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry triggers rich dynamics incompatible with a simple Bohmian trajectory interpretation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a powerful tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, critical for designing next-generation OAM-based experiments.",
