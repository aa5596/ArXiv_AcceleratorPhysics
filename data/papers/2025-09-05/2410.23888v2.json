  "title": "Timing performance of SiPM-on-Tile elements: Laboratory and test beam   measurements",
  "abstract": "The SiPM-on-Tile technology for highly granular calorimeters, where small plastic scintillator tiles are directly read out with SiPMs, has been developed for the CALICE Analog Hadron Calorimeter, and has been adopted for parts of the hadronic section of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. For future electron-positron colliders, a single cell time stamping on the sub-nanosecond level for energy deposits corresponding to single minimum-ionizing particles is desired to provide background rejection and to support pattern recognition and energy reconstruction with particle flow algorithms. To better understand the time resolution achievable with the SiPM-on-Tile technology, we have performed detailed measurements in test beams at DESY, probing scintillator tiles of different sizes. The study is complemented by laser measurements that provide insights into processes within the scintillator tile relevant for timing. In this publication, we will discuss our measurement methods and the results of our SiPM-on-Tile timing study.",
