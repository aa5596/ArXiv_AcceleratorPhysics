    "title": "The potential applications of muography to revealing sea shipwrecks",
    "abstract": "Muon imaging, a non-invasive technique leveraging naturally occurring cosmic muons, has emerged as a promising tool for exploring underwater objects, including shipwrecks. This article examines the potential of muon imaging to investigate the contents of wrecked ships in the Baltic Sea and other marine environments. By analyzing the principles of muon tomography, its applications in underwater archaeology, and its advantages over traditional methods, we highlight its potential to reveal hidden details within shipwrecks while addressing challenges posed by the marine environment. These wrecks pose significant environmental risks due to their hazardous contents, such as explosives and crude oil products, making their detection and monitoring a matter of environmental and safety concern. Accurate modeling and imaging of such wrecks are therefore crucial for assessing potential dangers and mitigating environmental impacts. In this work, we adopted an approach similar to that used in underground muon experiments. Muon propagation through 50 meters of seawater was simulated using GEANT4, with muons transported to a depth of 35 meters and recorded in a virtual detector. The saved distributions of particle type, kinetic energy, interaction position, and angular directions were then used as tabulated input to the PrimaryGeneratorAction module. This approach enabled the generation of a realistic underwater muon flux over a 20 m x 20 m surface at 35 meters depth, which was subsequently employed to simulate different shipwreck filling scenarios. Assuming an exposure time of one week for a wreck located at a depth of 50 meters, our simulations demonstrate that muon imaging can resolve density contrasts sufficiently to distinguish between water, oil, and high-density materials, underscoring its feasibility as a practical tool for underwater hazard assessment.",

    "title": "Charting the Luminosity Capabilities of the CERN Large Hadron Collider   with Various Nuclear Species",
    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4 improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the simulated projections put forward in this article.",

    "title": "The properties of resistive MHD modes and unstable spectra in advanced   tokamak regimes",
    "abstract": "Advanced tokamak regimes, featuring extended regions of low magnetic shear, are promising candidates for future fusion reactors but are also more prone to specific kinds of MHD instabilities. The proximity to a rational surface in a very low shear region weakens field line bending stabilisation and amplifies the effects of toroidal coupling between modes, leading to the emergence of long-wavelength resistive infernal modes. These modes can grow collectively as a discrete spectrum, leading to a cascade of different perturbations for single mode numbers $(m, n)$, with subdominant modes showing increasingly oscillatory radial structures. These spectra of fast-growing modes are significant for developing stable scenarios in future reactors, and for the understanding of global reconnection events like sawteeth, motivating a deeper investigation into their fundamental physics. Deriving new analytic solutions, including a generalisation of the ideal interchange dispersion relation to non monotonic $q$ profiles, and extending a modular linear resistive MHD solver, we investigate how resistivity, compressibility, toroidal effects, and shaping influence stability, especially in reversed shear $q$ profiles. It is also shown that common assumptions in numerical calculations prevent the observation of the full variety of modes present in these advanced scenarios.",

    "title": "The Compact Linear e$^+$e$^-$ Collider (CLIC)",
    "abstract": "The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear e$^+$e$^-$ collider studied by the international CLIC and CLICdp collaborations. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which normal-conducting high-gradient 12 GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages. The initial 380 GeV stage, with a site length of 11 km, optimally combines the exploration of Higgs and top-quark physics, including a top threshold scan near 350 GeV. A higher-energy stage, still using the initial single drive-beam complex, can be optimised for any energy up to 2 TeV. Parameters are presented in detail for a 1.5 TeV stage, with a site length of 29 km. Since the 2018 ESPPU reporting, significant effort was invested in CLIC accelerator optimisation, technology developments and system tests, including collaboration with new-generation light sources and free-electron lasers. CLIC implementation aspects at CERN have covered detailed studies of civil engineering, electrical networks, cooling and ventilation, scheduling, and costing. The CLIC baseline at 380 GeV is now 100 Hz operation, with a luminosity of 4.5$\\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and a power consumption of 166 MW. Compared to the 2018 design, this gives three times higher luminosity-per-power. The new baseline has two beam-delivery systems, allowing for two detectors operating in parallel. The cost estimate of the 380 GeV baseline is approximately 7.2 billion CHF. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could start as early as ~2034/35 with first beams following a decade later. This report summarises the CLIC project, its implementation and running scenarios, with emphasis on new developments and recent progress. It concludes with an update on the CLIC detector studies and on the physics potential in light of the improved accelerator performance.",

    "title": "Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere",
    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota & Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.",

    "title": "Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau   damping, and electron-ion energy partition",
    "abstract": "An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.",

The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry triggers rich dynamics incompatible with a simple Bohmian trajectory interpretation.

The obtained dependencies of the bunch length, field Ez, and mean longitudinal momentum pz on the channel radius are useful for further researches.",

    "abstract": "We present an extended investigation of a recently introduced model of gravitationally confined, collisionless plasma (Barbieri et al. 2024a), which showed that rapid temperature fluctuations at the base of the plasma, occurring on timescales much shorter than the electron crossing time, can drive the system into a non-thermal state characterized by anti-correlated temperature and density profiles, commonly referred to as temperature inversion. To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.",

In such environments, gravity tends to separate charged species. To prevent separation an electric field, classically described by the Pannekoek-Rosseland expression, is usually imposed externally. Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.",

    "abstract": "Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability, and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\\beta$ spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions (mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error = 0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998), validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\\beta$ spectroscopy. This AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization, real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is required.",

    "title": "Steels and Stainless Steels",
    "abstract": "Steels, and in particular stainless steels, play a crucial role in the construction of large particle accelerators and high-energy physics experiments, of fusion reactors and their superconducting magnet structures. Such projects face severe material challenges, as they require a wide application of tightly specified steel products and grades, featuring a controlled microstructure and adequate mechanical, physical, magnetic and vacuum properties over a wide temperature range. A broad spectrum of relevant examples is presented, issued from the experience maturated within decades of building of large vacuum, cryogenic and associated structural systems that must guarantee a reliable, long-lasting service with limited interventions. The requirements, and in turn the metallurgical processes applied to achieve the final stringent properties are discussed - dictated by mechanical, magnetic or vacuum compatibility constraints and often by a combination of them. Case studies are developed. The study of a few major failure analysis cases and their root causes is also addressed.",

    "abstract": "In cold weakly-ionized plasmas, Dreicer generation mechanism can be non-diffusive as demonstrated in [Y. Lee et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 17 175102 (2024)]. By expanding the previous letter, we present the detailed description of a proper collision operator to precisely account for the non-diffusive electron kinetics. The operator appropriately combines the Fokker-Planck operator and Boltzmann operator where free-bound collision cross sections are valid in low energy region. The proposed operator is envisaged to predict runaway electrons generations in cold weakly-ionized plasmas, particularly to design a runaway-free reactor tokamak startup.",

    "title": "Vibrational-Electron Heating in Plasma Flows: A Thermodynamically   Consistent Model",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium {plasma} flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron heating from vibrationally excited states. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc scaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the convergence of electron temperature and species-specific vibrational temperature ($T_{\\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a novel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously from the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational distribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields a simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\\exp(\\theta_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm e}-\\theta_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm v})$, where $\\theta_{\\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of the species under consideration. This formulation guarantees that $T_{\\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key advantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from swarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at low electron temperatures. For re-entry flows, the proposed approach predicts an electron temperature several times lower than previous models which results in improved agreement with some flight test data. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the modeling fidelity of plasma-assisted combustion, laser-induced plasmas, and various hypersonic plasma technologies such as electron transpiration cooling or magnetohydrodynamic force generators.",

This experiment is designed for the search for sterile neutrinos, and a muon tagging is an essential key component for the background rejection since the detector of the experiment is located over-ground, where is the 3rd floor of the J-PARC Material and Life experimental facility (MLF). Especially, stopping muons inside the detector create the Michel electrons, and they are important background to be rejected. Utilizing this innovative method, more than 99.8% of Michel electrons can be rejected even without a detector veto region. This technique can be employed for any experiments which uses the similar detector configurations.",

A total of $(9.3 \\pm 0.8)\\times 10^{5}$ ultracold neutrons were observed at a proton beam current of \\SI{37}{\\uA}, when the target was irradiated for a period of \\SI{60}{\\s}. The results are in fair agreement with expectations based on a detailed simulation of neutron transport and ultracold neutron source cryogenics. There is some indication that the new source might not be as limited by the conduction of heat through the He-II as originally expected.

    "title": "Solar Vortices as Conduits for Magnetoacoustic Waves: Multi-Layer   Coupling and Their Role in Atmospheric Heating",
    "abstract": "The Sun's atmosphere hosts swirling plasma structures, known as solar vortices, which have long been thought to channel wave energy into higher layers. Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.",

    "abstract": "As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.   This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.",

    "title": "Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion   Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies",
    "abstract": "Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\\sigma_i > 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \\sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.",

    "title": "The Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for PRIMA:   Approach and Estimated Performance",
    "abstract": "We present the architectural concept for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) for the Probe Mission for far-IR Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS spans the 24--235 micron range with four R ~ 100 slit-fed grating modules, each coupling to a 24 (spatial) by 84 (spectral) pixel array of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). All four arrays are read out simultaneously, and a point source of interest can be coupled to two of the four bands at a time. A Fourier transform module can be engaged over a portion of the FIRESS slits to create a high-resolution mode in which the light is intercepted, processed by the interferometer then reinserted into the path to the grating modules for detection. We provide a simulation and description of the technique that will be used to obtain high-resolution spectra. We identify the most important system requirements imposed by the detector system, finding that they are met with the existing design. Finally, we present our performance modeling, including both direct estimates given our current design status, as well as durable guidelines for developing general-observer programs.",

    "abstract": "Hot and tenuous plasmas are frequently far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, necessitating sophisticated methods for determining the associated plasma dielectric tensor and normal mode response. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (\\texttt{alps}) is a numerical tool for calculating such responses of plasmas with arbitrary gyrotropic background velocity distribution functions (VDFs). In order to model weakly and moderately damped plasma waves accurately, we have updated to the code to use an improved analytic continuation enabled by a polynomial basis representation. We demonstrate the continuity of solutions to the linear Vlasov--Maxwell dispersion relation between bi-Maxwellian and arbitrary VDF representations and evaluate the influence of VDF structure on mode polarization and wave power emission and absorption.",

    "title": "SOLPS-ITER Numerical Simulations of ITER-scale Snowflake Divertors:   Low-Field-Side SF-/SF+ and High-Field-Side SF-/SF+ Configurations",
    "abstract": "With edge plasma code SOLS-ITER, we study four Snowflake (SF) configurations for an ITER-size tokamak, with toroidal magnetic field BT=5T, major radius R=5m and plasma current Ip=10MA. Our aim is to provide insights on SF divertor design for future devices. In this work, the impacts of magnetic geometry and divertor target geometry in the four types of SF configurations on plasma behavior and power exhaust performance are investigated in detail. Low-recycling regime, high-recycling and detachment in the four types of SF divertors are obtained through an upstream density scan. The secondary X-point positions of SF divertors are systematically varied to examine their impact. For Low-Field-Side (LFS) SF- and High-Field-Side (HFS) SF- divertors the observed power splitting, induced by the secondary X-point, is consistent with experimental observations. The effect of target geometry is studied by comparing the flat target plates with the ITER-like divertor shape. The overall simulation results reveal a notable consequence of the LFS SF- divertor: closed structure of the inner target with high inclined plate can compress recycling neutrals originating from the HFS divertor region into the LFS SOL and PFR regions. This results in considerable volumetric dissipation through strong ionization and recombination, causing the connected outer target region to detach. This feature can be considered in the design of the LFS SF- divertor for future devices. For the LFS and HFS SF+ divertors, the region between the two X-points exhibits strong ionization and recombination sources close to the primary X-point. This feature might be beneficial for the formation of an X-point radiator, but would require further impurity seeding simulation study.",

Their aim is to capture the lowest-energy gamma rays of the observatory. The hereby proposed readout electronics architecture, serving as a proof-of-concept for its advanced camera upgrade, relies on a custom high-channel count fast sampling hardware digitizer board acting as a Front-End. The design includes a versatile pre-amplification stage and high-speed serial links for streaming JESD204C-compliant data at rates approaching 12 Gb/s per lane. The data get transferred to Back-End electronics for a first data-processing and trigger before being transmitted to event-building servers through 10 Gb/s Ethernet links. The performance of the link is exploited by implementing RDMA communication in hardware, thanks to a RoCEv2 core written in Bluespec SystemVerilog, enabling the possibility of transfer data directly to processing units without CPU intervention. Hardware design and characterization of the Front End board are reported, as well as a detailed description and tests of the Back End RDMA firmware.",

    "abstract": "Due to advances in equipment and intense research on plasma biomedical applications over the past few years, plasma devices are now suitable for clinical use. It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be designed in a way that ensures their safe operation and application whilst preserving the relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of such plasma devices remain high, which can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a low-cost plasma jet configuration is proposed in order to evaluate the device's viability for medical applications using argon as working gas. Typically, plasma jets operating with argon (Ar) generate high electrical currents, which makes them unsuitable for medical applications. With the proposed device modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Tests on water activation by plasma jets with and without the proposed modification indicate that both devices can yield comparable outcomes.",

    "title": "Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate- and Extremely   High-Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning",
    "abstract": "The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- to 5+ and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant ones influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called \"potentiality\". We focus on the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has been unclear from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL extracted solar wind velocity as the predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1+) and high-Kp ranges under southward IMF. In this study, the IMF three components, solar wind speed, and plasma density from the OMNI database (1998-2019), covering solar cycle 23 to early 25, were used as inputs. Again, PL selected solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for moderate and extremely high Kp. The potentiality of solar wind density for these ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than in the previous study, suggesting its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as PL inputs under all Kp levels. Above moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind if density is large, suggesting that not only velocity but also density contributes significantly. These PL and statistical investigations show that solar wind density begins to regulate Kp above moderate geomagnetic activity under southward IMF. They also help understand the relationship between solar wind and geomagnetic activity and forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.",

    "abstract": "The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems, coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting, summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.",

    "abstract": "In a small spherical tokamak with minor radius of 0.22 m and toroidal magnetic field of 1 T, it is possible to heat ions of a sufficiently dense plasma to an extremely high temperature up to 50 million Kelvin. To do this, it is necessary to transfer a sufficiently large torque to stabilize ion-scale turbulence and achieve ion heat transport at neoclassical level reaching extremely low values of plasma collisionality. It is also necessary to ensure good thermal insulation of electrons, which is always determined by turbulent transport. In a spherical tokamak, the toroidal magnetic field has a strong beneficial effect on suppressing turbulent electron heat fluxes. In the Globus-M2 tokamak, when heating plasma with high-energy atomic beams, a significant improvement in the plasma thermal energy confinement is observed with an increase in the toroidal magnetic field from 0.5 to 1 T. The comparison of our results with experiments on ST40 tokamak operating with toroidal magnetic field of 2 T indicates that further strong improvement of thermal insulation of spherical tokamak plasma in the region of higher magnetic fields is not expected.",

    "abstract": "We explore here the stochastic behavior of the DECAL sensor's noise output, and we evaluate its potential application as a true random number generator (TRNG) using time series analysis. The main objectives are twofold: first, to characterize the intrinsic noise properties of the DECAL sensor in the absence of external stimuli, and second, to determine the feasibility of employing the sensor as a source of randomness. The collected sensor data are examined through statistical and time series methodologies, and subsequently modeled using an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. This modeling approach enables the transformation of the sensor's raw noise into a Gaussian white noise sequence, which serves as the basis for generating random bits. The resulting random numbers are subjected to a series of statistical tests for randomness, including the NIST test suite. Our findings indicate that the method produces statistically sound random numbers. However, the rate of bit generation is relatively low, limiting its practicality for real-time TRNG applications under the current configuration. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that time series modeling presents a promising framework for extracting randomness from the DECAL sensor, and that with further optimization, the sensor could serve as a reliable and effective TRNG.",

    "title": "Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and   plasma density for laser-plasma experiments",
    "abstract": "Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.   Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.   In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.",

    "title": "Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins",
    "abstract": "Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.",

    "title": "Characterization of SiPMs at 40 K for neutrino coherent detection based   on pure CsI",
    "abstract": "Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), as the core photoelectric sensor for coherent neutrino detection in low-temperature pure CsI, its working performance directly determines the measurement accuracy of the scintillator light yield. Our previous research has fully demonstrated the performance of pure CsI at liquid nitrogen temperature. More intriguingly, its performance is expected to be even better at 40 K. However, the performance characteristics of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range still remain to be explored. In this study, a self-developed adjustable temperature control system ranging from 30 K to 293 K was built to investigate the key performance parameters of SiPM at different temperatures, such as single photoelectron spectrum, gain, breakdown voltage, dark count rate, after-pulse, internal crosstalk, and single photoelectron resolution. Special emphasis was placed on examining the key performance parameters of SiPM in the 40 K temperature range to evaluate its feasibility for light yield measurement in this temperature range. The results show that this study obtained the parameter variation trends and optimal working conditions of 3 types of SiPM at different temperatures, thereby improving the sensitivity of the detector. This research provides important technical support for low-temperature detection in neutrino physics experiments.",

    "abstract": "The SiPM-on-Tile technology for highly granular calorimeters, where small plastic scintillator tiles are directly read out with SiPMs, has been developed for the CALICE Analog Hadron Calorimeter, and has been adopted for parts of the hadronic section of the CMS High Granularity Calorimeter. For future electron-positron colliders, a single cell time stamping on the sub-nanosecond level for energy deposits corresponding to single minimum-ionizing particles is desired to provide background rejection and to support pattern recognition and energy reconstruction with particle flow algorithms. To better understand the time resolution achievable with the SiPM-on-Tile technology, we have performed detailed measurements in test beams at DESY, probing scintillator tiles of different sizes. The study is complemented by laser measurements that provide insights into processes within the scintillator tile relevant for timing. In this publication, we will discuss our measurement methods and the results of our SiPM-on-Tile timing study.",

    "title": "A Practical Flake Segmentation and Indexing Pipeline for Automated 2D   Material Stacking",
    "abstract": "A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and imaging conditions.",

    "title": "Real-Time Applicability of Emulated Virtual Circuits for Tokamak Plasma   Shape Control",
    "abstract": "Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective \"shaping currents\" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Amp\\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.",

By controlling the on-axis intensity, the density profile of the plasma ramps at the entrance and exit of the plasma can be tailored to optimize matching of the electron beam into the plasma.

    "abstract": "Thanks to the fabrication of large aperture phase optics, ultra-intense relativistic laser plasma interaction (RLPI) experiments with complex polarization states are becoming feasible. In this work, we perform a computational investigation of direct acceleration of electrons produced during ionization of underdense neon gas using a tightly focused and radially polarized Petawatt-class short pulse lasers by numerically solving the relativistically invariant Lorentz equations, incorporating semi-classical tunneling ionization and Monte Carlo type sampling of the focal volume. The accelerated electrons energy gain increases at longer laser wavelengths and GeV energies are reached for electrons ionized from the neon inner shells, which are field ionized near the peak of the pulse. Backward acceleration of electrons is observed for a range of initial positions and phases of ionization of neon charge states. This apparent counterintuitive phenomenon is directly linked to the radial polarization state of the incident laser beam that results in a strong longitudinal electric field Ez when tightly focused, where electrons ionized near the focal center at the phase when Ez is pointed toward the forward propagation direction experiences an initial push in the backward direction. A parametric study of the phenomenon by varying laser parameters is presented, and a 3D particle in cell (PIC) simulation is considered to confirm the existence of this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "This study presents an investigation of second harmonic generation (SHG) resulting from interaction of radially polarized laser beam propagating in homogeneous, unmagnetized plasma. Lorentz force and continuity equations have been used to derive the radial and axial current density components. Further, using these densities in the wave equation leads to analytical expressions for the SHG field amplitudes. These amplitudes exhibit periodic oscillations along the propagation axis, characterized by detuning length dependent on plasma density and laser parameters. Radial and axial contributions to SHG are found to be highly enhanced near the beam axis due to the Gaussian beam profile of the laser. The analytical findings are validated using Fourier Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulations. Notably, unlike linearly or circularly polarized beams which require either inhomogeneous or magnetized plasma, radially polarized beams facilitate efficient harmonic generation in homogeneous unmagnetized plasmas.",

    "title": "A Spin-Based Pathway to Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity",
    "abstract": "A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.",

Initial measurements with silicon and diamond samples are described. The apparatus is characterised with both devices, demonstrating the expected quadratic dependency with the energy per pulse, and different models are presented to explain the signal generated due to reflection. The signal generated in the silicon diode is in good agreement with one dimension voxel model predictions.",

    "abstract": "Effects of reversed magnetic shear on the plasma rotation stabilization of resistive wall modes in tokamaks are investigated using the AEGIS code. MHD equilibria in toroidal configuration from circular cross-sections to realistic CFETR-like scenarios with various magnetic shear profiles are considered. Two critical aspects of the $n=1$ RWM are examined: the influence of toroidal rotation on the unstable regime and the toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete stabilization. It is found that strongly reversed magnetic shear consistently broadens the unstable $\\beta_{\\rm N}$ window in both circular and CFETR equilibria when toroidal rotation is included. Furthermore, reversed magnetic shear significantly reduces the rotational stabilization, resulting in narrower stability windows and notably higher toroidal rotation frequency thresholds required for complete RWM suppression compared to the cases with positive shear only. These results clearly demonstrate that the reversed magnetic shear in the advanced tokamak configuration imposes more stringent requirement for the effective toroidal rotation stabilization of the $n=1$ RWM.",

We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.",
