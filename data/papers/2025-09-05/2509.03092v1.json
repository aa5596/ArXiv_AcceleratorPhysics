  "title": "Collision operator for electron runaway in cold weakly-ionized plasmas",
  "abstract": "In cold weakly-ionized plasmas, Dreicer generation mechanism can be non-diffusive as demonstrated in [Y. Lee et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133 17 175102 (2024)]. By expanding the previous letter, we present the detailed description of a proper collision operator to precisely account for the non-diffusive electron kinetics. The operator appropriately combines the Fokker-Planck operator and Boltzmann operator where free-bound collision cross sections are valid in low energy region. The proposed operator is envisaged to predict runaway electrons generations in cold weakly-ionized plasmas, particularly to design a runaway-free reactor tokamak startup.",
