  "title": "Theory uncertainties in predictions of strong-field QED",
  "abstract": "Experiments using high-power lasers and relativistic electron beams will soon be capable of precision testing of the theory of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. The comparison between experiment and theory always occurs via numerical simulations, but the lack of quantitative uncertainty bounds for the latter means that the origin of any discrepancies cannot be identified conclusively. Here I present a simulation framework that can place meaningful bounds on the theory uncertainties inherent to its operation. This work shows that the use of the locally constant field approximation leads to a theory uncertainty of a few per cent in the signals of quantum radiation reaction expected in near-term experiments.",
