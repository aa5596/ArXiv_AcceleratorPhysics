  "title": "Time Resolution Characterization of 4H-SiC LGADs with a ${}^{90}$Sr   Source",
  "abstract": "This work presents timing measurements of 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (4H-SiC LGADs) using beta particles from a ${}^{90}$Sr source. The 4H-SiC LGADs exhibit fast signal responses, and a time resolution of 61~ps was achieved, comparable to that of standard Si LGADs. The present limitation in the time resolution of 4H-SiC LGADs appears to stem from limited charge generation. Nevertheless, their higher voltage tolerance and faster carrier drift suggest that, with increased charge collection, their timing performance could approach or even surpass that of Si LGADs. These results demonstrate the strong potential of 4H-SiC LGADs as a robust platform for precision timing in future 4D tracking detectors, while also highlighting that signal charge is the dominant factor currently limiting their performance, indicating that further optimization of gain and drift structures will be essential for future development.",
