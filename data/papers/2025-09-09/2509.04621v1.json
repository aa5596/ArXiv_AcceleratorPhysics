  "title": "Shallow Angle Inverse Compton Scattering",
  "abstract": "Inverse Compton Scattering at shallow angles can be used to tune the spectrum and increase the brightness of the emitted radiation. Here, we report on the demonstration of emission of visible light by a 4.7 MeV $e$-beam crossing a 780 nm laser at 5.8$^{\\rm o}$ angle. Angular and spectral measurements of the radiation are in agreement with analytical and numerical predictions. We observe a characteristic dependence on the incoming polarization, not present in conventional head-on scattering, with suppression of the emission for $p$-polarization at condition equivalent to relativistic Brewster reflection.",
