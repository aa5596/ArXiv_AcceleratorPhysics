  "title": "Low-coherence interferometry with undetected mid-infrared photons in the   high-gain regime",
  "abstract": "We develop a high-parametric-gain SU(1,1) interferometer based on an aperiodically poled Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (apKTP) crystal, enabling frequency-domain low-coherence interferometry with undetected mid-infrared photons. The system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 40 dB and axial resolution of 30 $\\mu$m, with a 3 $\\mu$m-centered idler beam. By increasing the poling-period range, we also improve the axial resolution to 17 $\\mu$m, demonstrating a straightforward route to enhance the performance by working on the crystal design",
