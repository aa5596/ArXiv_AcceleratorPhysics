  "title": "A Simulation of the Fermilab Main Injector Dual Power Amplifier Cavities",
  "abstract": "The Fermilab Main Injector accelerating cavities have sparking issues when they are run at voltages higher than those required by the PIP-II project. This is a problem Fermilab is working on as planning begins for the next upgrade to the accelerator complex. One of the methods being used to address the issue is the development of a CST Microwave Studio simulation to accurately model the PIP-II dual power amplifier cavities and identify which part(s) of the cavity is causing sparking to develop. The model will also be used to determine if changes to the cavity geometry may allow the cavity to be used at higher voltages before sparking occurs.",
