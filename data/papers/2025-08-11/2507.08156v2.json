  "title": "Volume-Preserving Deformation of Honeycomb Wire Media Enables Broad   Plasma Frequency Tunability",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate tunability of the plasma frequency in a wire medium by mechanically deforming a lattice of parallel metallic wires arranged at the nodes of a honeycomb structure. Numerical simulations predict up to 78% tunability and a proof-of-concept experiment confirms 64%.",
