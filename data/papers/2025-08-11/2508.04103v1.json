  "title": "Compact and robust optical frequency reference module based on   reproducible and redistributable optical design",
  "abstract": "Stabilized optical frequency references (OFRs) are indispensable for atom-based quantum technologies, optical communications, and precision metrology. As these systems become more sophisticated, demands for compactness, robustness, and straightforward reproduction have grown. In this work, we present a robust 19-inch rack-mountable OFR module designed via a web-based CAD workflow that allows straightforward redistribution and reproduction. Its optical subsystem, designed based on a modeled laser beam path, places optical elements with sub-millimeter accuracy on a custom-machined aluminum plate, allowing straightforward assembly without extensive alignment and providing high mechanical stability. The module maintains frequency-stable operation for several months without user intervention and exhibits high robustness to mechanical vibrations up to 4g. All design files, including mechanical and optical metadata, are openly shared for straightforward reproduction and adaptation.",
