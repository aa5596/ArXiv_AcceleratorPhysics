  "title": "The nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of   magnetized plasma, generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulenc",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we present the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale two-dimensional compressed-sheared non-diffusive convective flows of a magnetized plasma generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the self-consistent evolution of the plasma and of the electrostatic field on the microscales, commensurable with the wavelength of the microscale instabilities and of the ion gyroradius, as well as on the macroscales of a bulk of plasma, is accounted for. It includes the theory of the formation of the macroscale spatially inhomogeneous compressed-sheared convective flows by the inhomogeneous microturbulence, the theory of the back reaction of the macroscale convected flows on the microturbulence, and of the slow macroscale responce of a bulk of plasma on the development of the compressed-sheared convective flows.",
