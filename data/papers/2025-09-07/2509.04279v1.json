  "title": "Energy Confinement Time Scaling for the Negative Triangularity Scenario   in DIII-D",
  "abstract": "Results from the 2023 negative triangularity campaign on DIII-D demonstrate encouraging energy confinement properties, similar to or exceeding the scaling of the IPB98(y,2) law. This paper describes the procedure with which a new scaling law was regressed specifically from the data from the DIII-D campaign. Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, measures were taken to minimize sampling bias and give a realistic estimate of the large uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as compared to the H-mode scaling law.",
