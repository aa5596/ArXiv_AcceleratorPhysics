  "title": "Generic Rolling Access to Synchrotron Radiation Facilities",
  "abstract": "A generic model for rolling access to synchrotron radiation experiments is presented, which has the capacity to replace call-based access models. Proposal submission, evaluation and scheduling are all executed in a rolling fashion. This significantly reduces the waiting times between proposal submission and experiment execution than that of the call-based access model. The generic rolling access model is in principle applicable to any beamlines, regardless of the number of experimental methods or setups it provides to users. This access model is flexible and could provide faster access compared to call-based access model as well as accommodate experiments and projects requiring extended preparation times.",
