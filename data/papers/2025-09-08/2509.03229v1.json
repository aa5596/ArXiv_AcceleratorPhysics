  "title": "Wakefield acceleration of self-injected bunch in a conical plasma   channels",
  "abstract": "Laser wakefield acceleration is a widely studied method for accelerating charged particle bunches, with selfinjection being a key feature. However, as the bunch accelerates beyond the driver velocity, it shifts out of the maximal accelerating wakefield phase. This work proposes using a tapering cone channel to address this issue. The gradual narrowing synchronizes the bunch with the wake phase by reducing the bubble size, keeping the bunch in the accelerating phase. The obtained dependencies of the bunch length, field Ez, and mean longitudinal momentum pz on the channel radius are useful for further researches.",
