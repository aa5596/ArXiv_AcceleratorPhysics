  "title": "An experimental setup for the study of gas-cell processes for the   S$^3$-Low Energy Branch",
  "abstract": "We present an experimental setup dedicated to the study of in-gas ion processes and characterization of gas stopping cells for the Low Energy Branch of the Super Separator Spectrometer (S$^3$) at SPIRAL2-GANIL. The first application is the development of a new gas stopper with a neutralization mechanism designed for faster extraction of the radioactive ions. This development should enable in-gas-jet laser spectroscopy and other low-energy experiments with shorter lived radioactive isotopes. We discuss in detail the motivation and objectives of these developments and we present the results of simulations performed in the design phase, as well as the first experimental results.",
