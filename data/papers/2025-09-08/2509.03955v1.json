  "title": "Beamstrahlung monitoring at SuperKEKB upgrade 2023",
  "abstract": "Beam monitoring is crucial for particle accelerators to achieve high luminosity. We describe an upgrade of the LABM, a beam monitoring device utilizing observation of the beamstrahlung, radiation emitted by a beam of charged particles when it accelerates in the electromagnetic field of another beam of charged particles.",
