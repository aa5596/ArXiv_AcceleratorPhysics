  "title": "Electrostatic toroidal bender and its fringe fields",
  "abstract": "I describe the COSY-Infinity code GES that we have developed and used in various forms in the past 30 years to calculate maps to third order through electrostatic bend elements. It has been a mystery that COSY's in-built procedures ES, ESP and ECL disagreed with our own code. This note is intended to clarify the issue.",
