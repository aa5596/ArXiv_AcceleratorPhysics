  "title": "RENE experiment for the sterile neutrino search using reactor neutrinos",
  "abstract": "This paper summarizes the details of the Reactor Experiment for Neutrinos and Exotics (RENE) experiment. It covers the detector construction, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation study, and physics expectations. The primary goal of the RENE project is to investigate the sterile neutrino oscillation at $\\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\\sim 2\\,{\\rm{eV}^{2}}$. which overlap with the allowed region predicted by the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA). On the other hand, the STEREO and PROSPECT experiments have excluded certain regions of the parameter space with 95 \\% confidence level (C.L.), while the joint study conducted by RENO and NEOS suggests possible indications of sterile neutrinos at $\\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}\\sim2.4\\,{\\rm{eV}^{2}}$ and $\\sim{1.7}{\\,\\rm{eV}^{2}}$ with sin$^{2}\\theta_{41} < 0.01$. Accordingly, a more meticulous investigation of these remaining regions continues to be a scientifically valuable endeavor. This paper reports the technical details of the detector and physics objectives.",
