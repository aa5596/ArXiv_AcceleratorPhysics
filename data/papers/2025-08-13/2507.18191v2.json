  "title": "Characterisation of the signal to noise ratio of 2-photon microscopes",
  "abstract": "Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a key performance metric of an imaging instrument. Here we describe characterisation of SNR of a custom 2-photon microscope and compare the SNR performance of our microscope with selected commercial 2-photon microscopes. The methodology described in this paper can serve as guidance for others wishing to characterise and benchmark their 2-photon or other point-scanning microscopes.",
