    "title": "Dark Count Rate Stability of JUNO 20-inch PMTs in Mass Testing",
    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an ambitious multipurpose neutrino experiment designed to determine the neutrino mass ordering, with an impressive energy resolution goal of at least 3% at 1 MeV. To achieve a photon detection coverage of approximately 75%, JUNO will utilize two types of 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs): the large PMT (LPMT) and the microchannel plate PMT (MCP-PMT). A significant concern in high-precision neutrino measurements is the dark count rate (DCR) of PMTs, which introduces noise that can adversely affect energy measurement accuracy. During the mass testing phase of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, comprehensive measurements of the DCR were undertaken. These measurements not only captured the DCR values of individual PMTs but also examined the stability and temperature dependence of the DCR at an operating gain of (1x10^7). This paper presents a detailed characterization of the DCR of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, investigating factors such as cooling time, temperature variations, and long-term stability using the JUNO Pan-Asia PMT testing facilities. The results reveal distinct DCR characteristics between the two types of PMTs, providing valuable insights into the nature of DCR and its implications for JUNO's scientific objectives. In addition to performance characterization, we implemented a monitoring system to track DCR stability over time. Notably, several spikes in DCR were identified, prompting a preliminary investigation into their causes. Potential factors contributing to these spikes, such as flasher events, were explored using coincidence rate analysis and complementary imaging techniques. The findings from this study are crucial for optimizing the performance of PMTs in JUNO, ultimately aiding the experiment in achieving its goals related to neutrino physics.",

    "title": "A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp time is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp times are less than the ramp times in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp times are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.",

    "title": "AC Magnetometry Loop Tracer Compatible with Magnetic Calorimetry for   Power Loss Analysis",
    "abstract": "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have garnered significant attention for various applications in the high-kHz-to-MHz range, although their magnetic characterization at these operational conditions has been limited. However, a number of recent studies have showcased high-frequency and high-field amplitude AC magnetometry loop tracers capable of retrieving the magnetic AC hysteresis curve and the associated magnetic properties. In this paper, we present an easily constructable loop tracer that is retrofitted into an existing AC calorimetry setup. This enables the loop tracer to function simultaneously with the AC calorimetry setup and also to be run as a high-frequency AC susceptometer. The loop tracer is shown to work in the frequency range 160-922 kHz with maximum applied fields from 18 to 46 mT depending on the frequency. An iron oxide nanoflower sample is used to test the loop tracer, showcasing high reproducibility in measured magnetic parameters as well as quantitative agreement between the different measurement methods in the setup.",

    "title": "Introducing a Markov Chain-Based Time Calibration Procedure for   Multi-Channel Particle Detectors: Application to the SuperFGD and ToF   Detectors of the T2K Experiment",
    "abstract": "Inter-channel mis-synchronisation can be a limiting factor to the time resolution of high performance timing detectors with multiple readout channels and independent electronics units. In these systems, time calibration methods employed must be able to efficiently correct for minimal mis-synchronisation between channels and achieve the best detector performance. We present an iterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector systems with multiple readout channels. Starting from correlated hit pairs alone, and without requiring an external reference time measurement, the method solves for fixed per-channel offsets, with precision limited only by the intrinsic single-channel resolution. A mathematical proof that the method is able to find the correct time offsets to be assigned to each detector channel in order to achieve inter-channel synchronisation is given, and it is shown that the number of iterations to reach convergence within the desired precision is controllable with a single parameter. Numerical studies are used to confirm unbiased recovery of true offsets. Finally, the application of the calibration method to the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and the Time of Flight (TOF) detector at the upgraded T2K near detector (ND280) shows good improvement in overall timing resolution, demonstrating the effectiveness in a real-world scenario and scalability.",

The tOAM structure is driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the medium, originating from the magnetic Lorentz force, even for weak light fields. There are two contributions to the material tOAM: one part depends on the pulse spatial shape change as it passes through an interface, and the other part depends on dispersion. The results, from first principles particle-in-cell simulations of a simple plasma, are in excellent agreement with our theory for general dielectric media [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. For plasma, there is agreement up to near-critical densities and near-relativistic field strengths.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{k}}/E_{\\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.",

    "abstract": "Slow positrons are increasingly important to the study of material surfaces. For these kinds of studies, the positrons must have low emittance and relatively high brightness. Unfortunately, fast positron sources like radioactive capsules or linac driven sources have broad energy and angular spread, which make them difficult to capture and use. Moderators are materials that produce slow, mono-energetic positrons from a fast positron beam. Since their efficiencies are typically less than $10^{-3}$ slow $e^+$ per fast $e^+$, research into how to maximize efficiency is of great interest. Previous work has shown that using a linac, one can decelerate the fast positron beam in order to greatly increase moderation efficiency. We present here start-to-end simulations using G4beamline to model a 100 MeV electron beam incident upon a Tungsten target, focused by an adiabatic matching device, and decelerated by a 1.3 GHz, 5-cell pillbox cavity. We show that by decelerating the positrons after their creation we can increase the number of positrons under 500 keV by 15 times, translating to a 16.3 times improvement in moderation efficiency, and therefore leading to a brighter positron source.",

All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD uses 2D, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the 3D, extended MHD code M3D-C1 uses 2D, unstructured C1 elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction and a regular grid that is partially aligned with the magnetic field. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which NIMROD does at the formulation level, but M3D-C1 uses a full 3D discretization. The resulting algebraic system is solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the M3D-C1 velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC - Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation - block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC4 disruption, and the next steps in the development of this solver are outlined.",

    "title": "Analytical and Numerical Studies of Dark Current in Radiofrequency   Structures for Short-Pulse High-Gradient Acceleration",
    "abstract": "High-gradient acceleration is a key research area that could enable compact linear accelerators for future colliders, light sources, and other applications. In the pursuit of high-gradient operation, RF breakdown limits the attainable accelerating gradient in normal-conducting RF structures. Recent experiments at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator suggest a promising approach: using short RF pulses with durations of a few nanoseconds. Experimental studies show that these O(1 ns) RF pulses can mitigate breakdown limitations, resulting in higher gradients. For example, an electric field of nearly 400 MV/m was achieved in an X-band photoemission gun driven by 6-ns-long RF pulses, with rapid RF conditioning and low dark current observed. Despite these promising results, the short-pulse regime remains an under-explored parameter space, and RF breakdown physics under nanosecond-long pulses requires further investigation. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical simulations of dark current dynamics in accelerating cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. We study breakdown-associated processes spanning different time scales, including field emission, multipacting, and plasma formation, using simulations of the X-band photogun cavities. The results reveal the advantages of using short RF pulses to reduce dark current and mitigate RF breakdown, offering a path toward a new class of compact accelerators with enhanced performance and reduced susceptibility to breakdown.",

Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive simulation-based optimization of gallium nitride (GaN)-based metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors designed for ultraviolet (UV) applications. The proposed device architecture incorporates a novel indium nitride/gallium nitride/aluminum nitride (InN/GaN/AlN) heterostructure integrated on a sapphire substrate, combined with refined doping strategies and interdigitated electrode geometry. By systematically analyzing the effects of mesa layer thickness, buffer layers, substrate type, and doping concentrations, we demonstrate significant enhancements in photocurrent generation, photoabsorption rate, and spectral responsivity. Notably, replacing the conventional sapphire substrate with silicon carbide (SiC) and introducing low-level p-type and n-type (p-n) doping into the GaN region enables p-i-n diode-like behavior, contributing to reduced dark current and improved UV selectivity. Building upon these structural enhancements, the final geometric optimization of the nickel/gold (Ni/Au) electrode fingers led to an approximately eight-fold increase in photocurrent compared to the initial design, representing the most significant contribution to the improvement in absorption efficiency. These findings offer an effective route for designing next-generation MSM photodetectors with improved sensitivity, noise performance, and thermal compatibility, suitable for high-performance ultraviolet detection applications.",

    "title": "Polywell Revisited",
    "abstract": "The Polywell fusion concept, originally proposed by Robert W. Bussard in 1985, has been investigated for over four decades as a potential solution for achieving net fusion energy in a compact and economically viable reactor. It combines two distinct approaches: high-beta magnetic cusp confinement of electrons using polyhedral coil configurations and electrostatic ion confinement via a potential well formed by injected electron beams. While the hybrid nature of the Polywell system offers advantages in plasma stability and engineering simplicity, previous efforts have been limited by persistent challenges in achieving sufficient plasma confinement required to generate a net energy gain. In this study, we examine previous work and identify limitations of several Polywell embodiments that have historically impeded progress. We present an updated Polywell physics model incorporating experimental findings and recent first-principles particle-in-cell simulations. This updated model outlines a credible path toward overcoming confinement losses and achieving net energy gain using deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuels. Our findings provide a renewed scientific basis for the continued development of the Polywell fusion concept as a practical and scalable approach to fusion energy.",

    "abstract": "We deployed MOSKITA $\\sim$33 m away from the CMS collision point, the first skipper-CCD detector probing low-energy particles produced in high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we search for beam-related events using data collected in 2024 during beam-on and beam-off periods. The dataset corresponds to integrated luminosities of 113.3 fb$^{-1}$ and 1.54 nb$^{-1}$ for the proton-proton and Pb-Pb collision periods, respectively. We report observed event rates in a model-independent framework across two ionization regions: $\\leq20e^-$ and $>20e^-$. For the low-energy region, we perform a likelihood analysis to test the null hypothesis of no beam-correlated signal. We found no significant correlation during proton-proton and Pb-Pb collisions. For the high-energy region, we present the energy spectra for both collision periods and compare event rates for images with and without luminosity. We observe a slight increase in the event rate following the Pb-Pb collisions, coinciding with a rise in the single-electron rate, which will be investigated in future work. Using the low-energy proton-proton results, we place 95% C.L. constraints on the mass-millicharge parameter space of millicharged particles. Overall, the results in this work demonstrate the viability of skipper-CCD technology to explore new physics at high-energy colliders and motivate future searches with more massive detectors.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers remains challenging in realistic environments dominated by strong and variable radio-frequency interference. Traditional radio-array operations rely on external particle-detector triggers, limiting sensitivity and increasing system complexity. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating that deep-learning-based triggering can operate in such high-noise conditions and can be implemented within the strict latency constraints of large-scale radio observatories. Using measured high-interference noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network classifier was trained and optimised for robust separation of signals from background at MHz-scale trigger-trial rates. The trained model was quantised with HLS4ML to fixed-point precision and synthesised using Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference latencies. These results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference, enabled by high-level synthesis, can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, potentially removing the need for external trigger systems and reducing array complexity.",

In order to accelerate DUNE's physics reach and ensure robust beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. A physics-informed digital twin is at the heart of this Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor. By reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be reduced from 5\\% to 1\\%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US-Japan R\\&D effort will deploy a LGAD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. Time of Flight (ToF) measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects. Simulations confirm strong responses to these effects. Machine learning models can predict beam quality and horn current with sub-percent accuracy. This scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity and reduces systematics, transforming high-power accelerator operations.",

    "title": "Simulating X-point radiator turbulence",
    "abstract": "Coupling a high-performance burning plasma core to a detached boundary solution is critical for realizing magnetic confinement fusion power. Predictive simulations of the edge and scrape-off layer are therefore essential and must self-consistently account for turbulence and the interplay between the plasma, neutral gas, and impurities. We present results on controlled full detachment in ASDEX Upgrade with an X-point radiator (XPR), obtained with the edge turbulence code GRILLIX. Assuming a fixed nitrogen concentration (in terms of the electron density) in coronal equilibrium, two simulations are discussed: they exhibit dense nitrogen radiation fronts, located 5 and 12 cm above the X-point, accounting for 80 % of the input heating power. In validations against density, temperature, and bolometry measurements, the simulations show good agreement and reproduce the detached divertor conditions observed in the experiment. Neutral gas is critical for achieving detachment and modulating the height of the XPR front, in agreement with previous SOLPS-ITER transport modeling and analytical power balance studies. In addition, the front structure is highly dynamic due to turbulence, consisting of ionizing and radiative mantles surrounding intermittent cold spots of recombining plasma. Near the detachment front, density and temperature fluctuation amplitudes exceed the background by more than 400 %, compared to 40 % in an attached reference case. The radial electric field shifts inward, poloidal symmetry of the electrostatic potential is broken (inducing strong radial flows around the XPR), and radial particle and heat transport into the low-field side scrape-off layer increases. These effects may explain the ELM suppression observed in the H-mode XPR regime.",

    "abstract": "Compact, stable, and versatile laser-driven ion sources hold great promise for applications ranging from medicine to materials science and fundamental physics. While single-shot sources have demonstrated favorable beam properties, including the peak fluxes necessary for several applications, high repetition rate operation will be necessary to generate and sustain the high average flux needed for many of the most exciting applications of laser-driven ion sources. Further, to navigate through the high-dimensional space of laser and target parameters towards experimental optima, it is essential to develop ion acceleration platforms compatible with machine learning learning techniques and capable of autonomous real-time optimization. Here we present a multi-Hz ion acceleration platform employing a liquid sheet jet target. We characterize the laser-plasma interaction and the laser-driven proton beam across a variety of key parameters governing the interaction using an extensive suite of online diagnostics. We also demonstrate real-time, closed-loop optimization of the ion beam maximum energy by tuning the laser wavefront using a Bayesian optimization scheme. This approach increased the maximum proton energy by 11% compared to a manually-optimized wavefront by enhancing the energy concentration within the laser focal spot, demonstrating the potential for closed-loop optimization schemes to tune future ion accelerators for robust high repetition rate operation.",

    "abstract": "We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character, forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a \"virtual\" bright field or dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.",

To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias<5mm) and 12mm (bias<1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment.

    "title": "Studies on the effect of low-fluence proton and neutron irradiation on   n-type LGADs",
    "abstract": "The presented study investigates the effects of low fluences from $5\\times10^{12}$ up to $1\\times10^{14}$ particles/cm$^{2}$ of 60MeV proton and neutron irradiation on n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (nLGADs). An nLGAD is a silicon sensor with a highly doped gain layer that enables controlled charge multiplication via impact ionization. In contrast to the well-established p-type LGADs for high-energy physics (HEP) applications, nLGADs are optimized for the detection of low-penetrating particles such as UV photons and soft X-rays. In addition to studying their potential application in environments with radiation backgrounds, these novel devices also enable the exploration of the underlying phenomenology arising from the combination of n-type bulk material with a gain layer, which degradation was previously studied predominantly in the context of p-type LGADs. The irradiation effects were characterized through measurements of the leakage current and capacitance with increasing bias voltage (I-V and C-V), revealing systematic and fluence-dependent behavior related to space charge sign inversion (SCSI) of the n-type bulk material, which especially alters the electric field in the sensor and thus the depletion behavior. Additionally, annealing studies were performed to assess both beneficial and reverse annealing regimes with isothermal and isochronal annealing. The findings are consistent with previous high-energy proton studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental behavior of nLGADs under irradiation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our work is to analyze size distributions of particles and their agglomerates in imagery from astrophysical microgravity experiments. The data acquired in these experiments are given by sequences consisting of several hundred images. It is desirable to establish an automated routine that helps to assess size distributions of important image structures and their dynamics in a statistical way.   The main technique we adopt to this end is the morphological granulometry. After preprocessing steps that facilitate granulometric analysis, we show how to extract useful information on size of particle agglomerates as well as underlying dynamics. At hand of the discussion of two different microgravity key experiments we demonstrate that the granulometric analysis enables to assess important experimental aspects. We conjecture that our developments are a useful basis for the quantitative assessment of microgravity particle experiments.",

    "title": "Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Bubble Evolution in   Alkaline Water Electrolyzers",
    "abstract": "Improved understanding of gas/liquid transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems is increasingly demanded for optimizing device performance. However, high-resolution measurement techniques for in-situ imaging remain limited. This work demonstrates the use of volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for quantifying hydrogen bubble evolution in porous nickel electrodes in a customized alkaline water electrolysis cell. By using high-frequency focused ultrasound, SAM enables volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution in the range of tens of micrometers. This allows the distribution of gas bubbles within the complex 3D architecture of porous electrodes to be resolved. Digital image processing methods are used to segment and quantify the gas content in the electrode. Thus, non-destructive SAM imaging is demonstrated to be an accessible and scalable analytical tool for the quantitative investigation of bubble evolution in operando electrochemical environments. Here, a solid foundation is established for future studies aimed at optimizing bubble dynamics and cell design under practically relevant operating conditions, ultimately contributing to higher electrolysis efficiencies.",

    "title": "Constraining Active Galactic Nucleus Jets with Spectrum and Core Shift:   The Case of M87",
    "abstract": "We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.",

    "abstract": "We present the first gyrokinetic simulations of multiscale turbulence in a stellarator, using the magnetic geometry of Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and experimentally relevant parameters. A broad range of scenarios is explored, including regimes where electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) turbulence coexists with varying levels of ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) turbulence, as well as cases involving microtearing modes (MTMs) relevant to high-$\\beta$ and reactor-like conditions. Notably, while ETG turbulence does not form radial streamers as in tokamaks, it can still drive significant transport and interact with ion-scale turbulence. In electrostatic ITG-dominated regimes, electron-scale fluctuations erode zonal flows, enhancing ion-scale transport, while ion-scale turbulence suppresses ETG activity. In contrast, under electromagnetic MTM conditions, the isotropic nature of ETG turbulence limits its suppressive effect, allowing MTMs to persist. These findings underscore the critical role of cross-scale effects for accurate transport predictions in W7-X and future stellarators.",

    "title": "Development and performance test of p-type Silicon pad array detector",
    "abstract": "This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\\times$~9 array of 1~$\\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage (CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low Bjorken-x region.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of an ultraintense Nd:glass laser pulse with a near-critical plasma self-organizes into a highly efficient $\\gamma$-ray source. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that relativistic self-focusing, aided by a self-generated electron cavity, enhances the laser intensity by more than an order of magnitude, driving the system into the radiation-reaction-dominated regime, i.e. one where the electrons lose a substantial amount of their energy as hard radiation. Peak photon emission occurs near $0.5$ times the relativistic critical density, with a $\\gamma$-photon yield exceeding $20\\%$ of the laser energy. Compared to Ti:Sa lasers of the same power, the longer duration of Nd:glass laser pulses leads to an order of magnitude increase in $\\gamma$-photon number in the extreme conversion efficiency regime, making them particularly well-suited for photonuclear physics applications. These findings point to a robust and scalable mechanism for compact, ultra-bright $\\gamma$-ray generation in the multi-petawatt regime.",

    "abstract": "The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \\textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal control of laser pulses at relativistic intensities is a longstanding goal with broad implications in laser-plasma acceleration, high-brightness radiation sources, and extreme-field science. Laser pulses with helical spatiotemporal intensity profiles, often referred to as light springs, carry multiple spectral and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, producing a rotating intensity profile capable of coupling directly to helical plasma waves. Until now, light springs have only been realized on low-power systems, limited by optical damage thresholds and large-aperture beamline constraints. Here, we report the first experimental realization of light springs at relativistic intensities, achieving peak intensities above $1.4\\times10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$. Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints distinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them. Hyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction confirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive superluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates further control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure. This platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where laser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.",

    "abstract": "Electron transpiration cooling (ETC) offers a promising approach for thermal management of hypersonic vehicles by leveraging thermionic emission from the leading edge. While emitted electrons cool the surface, subsequent collection of flowfield electrons induces heating, limiting ETC effectiveness unless collection occurs in cooler aftbody regions. Most existing ETC studies neglect this heating contribution, assuming ideal downstream collection. This work integrates a one-dimensional collisionless plasma sheath model into a discretized leading-edge framework to predict surface potentials and charged-particle fluxes. A parametric study examines how plasma and vehicle properties affect ETC performance. Results reveal that passive ETC is susceptible to thermionic space-charge overcompensation, which can reverse the intended cooling effect and cause surface heating at high plasma densities. Flowfield electron heating can be mitigated but not eliminated by using dielectric coatings or blunt geometries. The same mechanisms that protect blunt bodies from adverse electrical conduction and flowfield heating also preclude incorporation of ETC-based cooling in those vehicle geometries.",

This work aims to contribute to our current understanding by comparing the nonlinear evolution of Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators to that of nonlinearly stable quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks. A high mirror, very low $\\iota$, W7-X-like configuration is first simulated. A second case is then considered using experimental reconstructions of intermediate $\\beta$ W7-AS discharges, where saturated low-n modes were observed experimentally, with sustained MHD signatures over tens of milliseconds. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation, and the observation of partial reconnection in contrast to flux pumping are discussed, in view of reproducing and designing for operation of stellarators beyond the Mercier stability limit.",

    "title": "Reconstruction of 2D line-integrated electron density using angular   filter refractometry and a fast marching Eikonal solver",
    "abstract": "Refraction of an optical probe beam by a plasma can be measured with angular filter refractometry (AFR), which produces an image containing intensity contours that correspond to curves of constant refraction angle. Further analysis is required to reconstruct the underlying line-integrated electron density. Most prior efforts to calculate density from AFR data have been limited to 1D analysis or forward-fitting techniques. In this paper, we detail the use of a fast marching Eikonal solver to directly invert AFR data and obtain the 2D line-integrated electron density. The analysis method is first verified with synthetic data and then applied to laser-driven experiments of single and double plume expansion collected at the OMEGA EP Laser Facility. The calculated densities agree with 1D results and are shown to be consistent with the original AFR measurements via forward modeling. We also discuss how additional measurements could improve the precision of this technique.",

    "title": "Ultra-sensitive radon assay using an electrostatic chamber in a   recirculating system",
    "abstract": "Rare event searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay and Weakly Interacting Massive Particle detection require ultra-low background detectors. Radon contamination is a significant challenge for these experiments, which employ highly sensitive radon assay techniques to identify and select low-emission materials. This work presents the development of ultra-sensitive electrostatic chamber (ESC) instruments designed to measure radon emanation in a recirculating gas loop, for future lower background experiments. Unlike traditional methods that separate emanation and detection steps, this system allows continuous radon transport and detection. This is made possible with a custom-built recirculation pump. A Python-based analysis framework, PyDAn, was developed to process and fit time-dependent radon decay data. Radon emanation rates are given for various materials measured with this instrument. A radon source of known activity provides an absolute calibration, enabling statistically-limited minimal detectable activities of 20 $\\mu$Bq. These devices are powerful tools for screening materials in the development of low-background particle physics experiments.",

    "title": "A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for   correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon   counting detectors",
    "abstract": "A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.",

    "title": "Transport of Particles in Strongly Turbulent 3D Magnetized Plasmas",
    "abstract": "In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense (large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give rise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets, filaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which critically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this turbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge, stochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration within open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in energy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric fields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic heating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel electric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of strong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in finite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of Kappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the two energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and can be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast, systematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a fractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the fractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional transport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic acceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of turbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages, contributing to gradual particle energization.",

    "title": "Frobenius-Perron Operator Approach to the Beam-Beam Interaction in   Circular Colliders",
    "abstract": "Unlike most publications devoted to the application of the self-consistent method of the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system to the study of beam-beam interaction, in this article an alternative strategy using the elegant approach of the Frobenius-Perron operator for symplectic twist maps has been developed. A detailed analysis of the establishment of an equilibrium density distribution in phase space, as well as the behavior of the perturbed distribution function with respect to the coherent stability of the two beams, has been carried out.   Using the Renormalization Group technique for the reduction of the Frobenius-Perron operator, the case where the unperturbed rotation frequency (unperturbed betatron tune) of the map is far from any structural resonance driven by the beam-beam kick perturbation has been analyzed in detail. It has been shown that up to second order in the beam-beam parameter, the renormalized map propagator with nonlinear stabilization describes a random walk of the angle variable, implying that there exists an equilibrium distribution function depending only on the action variable.   The linearized Frobenius-Perron operators for each beam imply a discrete form of the linearized Vlasov equations, which essentially comprises a new method for calculating coherent beam-beam instabilities using a matrix mapping technique. In the special case of an isolated coherent beam-beam resonance, a stability criterion for coherent beam-beam resonances has been found in closed form.   An intriguing particular concerning the effect of repeated beam-beam collisions on collider luminosity has been derived explicitly. An addition of luminosity per kick (small though, of the order of the beam-beam parameter) in the course of successive beam-beam collisions could be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.",

    "abstract": "The effect of magnetic shear on ballooning-driven plasma edge turbulence is studied through nonlinear simulations complemented by linear numerical and analytical investigations. Nonlinear, 3D, global, flux-driven simulations using the GBS code show that the scale separation between radial, x, and poloidal, y, size of turbulent eddies, kx << ky , considered by Ricci et al. (2008) and extensively used to predict pressure gradient lengths, SOL width, particle and heat fluxes, is observed with high magnetic shear. In contrast, for low magnetic shear, kx ~ ky is observed, with fluctuation properties resembling those shown by recent low-shear stellarator simulations reported in Coelho et al. (2024a). Global linear investigations of the ballooning mode qualitatively captures the transition in mode structure with varying magnetic shear, showing that kx << ky is achieved with sufficiently strong poloidal mode coupling enhanced by increasing magnetic shear, resistivity, toroidal mode number, and equilibrium gradient scale length. This is confirmed by an analytical study considering a dominant poloidal mode and its sidebands, which highlights that the poloidal mode structure is determined by curvature and k parallel effects",

    "title": "The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter   Experiments",
    "abstract": "Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments and gains acceleration on GPUs. It is suitable for dynode PMTs, and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the conventional method of waveform integration.",
