    "title": "Rapid-cycling ReBCO dipole magnet concept for muon acceleration",
    "abstract": "We present a concept of the rapid-cycling 1.7 T ReBCO magnet for 1 to 10 kT/s ramping range as required for muon acceleration in a future muon collider presently under study. This approach is based on the 6 kA CORC-like cable constructed with 12 superconducting ReBCO tapes of 2 mm width. Based on theoretical prediction there is a linear scaling of the ReBCO cable hysteresis loss with the crossing magnetic field possibly generating power loss independent of the magnetic field ramping speed. This feature makes this ReBCO cable suitable for the construction of rapid-cycling magnets. In this work we outline the design of a dipole magnet for 1.7 T gap magnetic field and discuss the helium coolant parameters for the minimal electric power.",

    "title": "Numerical Studies for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\\_LAB Plasma Beam Driven Working   Point",
    "abstract": "The realization of a plasma based user facility on the model of EuPRAXIA@SPARC\\_LAB requires to design a working point for the operation that allows to get an high accelerating gradient preserving a low emittance and low energy spread of the accelerated beam. Such beam is supposed to pilot a soft x-ray free electron laser with a wavelength of 2-\\SI{4}{\\nano\\meter}. In this work several simulation scans are presented, varying at the same time the plasma density and driver-witness separation in order to show that, in a realistic working point for EuPRAXIA@SPARC\\_LAB, it is possible to find an ideal compromise for a witness with a peak current >1kA that allows to preserve the energy spread of the core (80\\% of the charge) below 0.1\\%, while maintaining an accelerating gradient inside the plasma module around of 1 GV/m. The study is completed with a parametric analysis with the aim of establishing the stability requirements of the RF working point and the plasma channel in order to preserve the energy jitter at the same level of the energy spread.",

    "title": "Twinac: A Universal Framework for Virtual Accelerator Controls",
    "abstract": "We propose a universal framework for a system of virtual accelerator controls (Twinac), a standard toolkit for research institutions to design, maintain, and use a real-time, end-to-end \"digital twin\" of their particle accelerator facility. This virtual counterpart will mirror any physical accelerator to provide (1) predictive maintenance; (2) surveillance of hidden environmental factors, such as seasonal temperature variations, which could impact performance of power supplies, magnets, and other instruments; and (3) a capability to model novel ways to operate the accelerator without risking equipment damage. Twinac is envisioned as accelerator facility agnostic, allowing institutions to share and reuse myriad simulation approaches (analytics-based, A.I.-driven, or combinations of the like) across facilities. The Twinac system lays the groundwork for a collaborative network of institutions to maintain and update this shared virtual accelerator technology.",
