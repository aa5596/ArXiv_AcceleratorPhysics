  "title": "Laguerre-Gaussian pulses for spin-polarized ion beam acceleration",
  "abstract": "Polarized particle sources have a plethora of applications, ranging from deep-inelastic scattering to nuclear fusion. One crucial challenge in laser-plasma interaction is maintaining the initial polarization of the target. Here, we propose the acceleration of spin-polarized Helium-3 from near-critical density targets using high-intensity Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that Magnetic Vortex Acceleration with these modes yields higher polarization on the 90%-level compared to conventional Gaussian laser pulses, while also providing low-divergence beams.",
