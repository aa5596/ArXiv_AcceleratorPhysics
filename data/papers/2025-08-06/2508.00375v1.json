  "title": "A COGENT case study: Supporting Applications with Chombo",
  "abstract": "We present a case study of how a software framework (Chombo) supported the specific needs of a scientific application (COGENT). Since its inception in 2000, the Chombo framework has supported various applications. One example of such support has been the collaboration with the Edge Simulation Laboratory to build the COGENT model. The specific needs of the COGENT effort required the design and implementation of a set of new capabilities in the Chombo framework, such as higher-order mapped-multiblock discretizations and multi-dimensional code organization. These capabilities allowed COGENT to develop a unique simulation capability for modeling the edge layers in tokamaks. Once developed, these capabilities were able to support other applications which had similar needs.",
