  "title": "EIE calculation and Collisional-Radiative modeling for Na-like Kr and Xe",
  "abstract": "As an extension to our previous work [1], a comprehensive theoretical study for Na-like Krypton and Xenon is carried out. Using MCDHF (Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartee-Fock) along with RDW (Relativistic distorted wave) theory we calculate key atomic properties, electron-impact excitation (EIE), rate coefficients, and collision strength for these ions. We use these parameters to build a Collisional-Radiative model for Na-like Krypton and Xenon. For Na-like Krypton we compare our computed excitation energy, EIE cross-sections, rate coefficients, emission line intensity with previous work. Additionally we investigate variation of line ratios with temperature. For Na-like Xenon we compared excitation energy for various fine-structure with NIST( [2]) database and then provide our computed results for EIE cross-section,intensity profile, and the temperature dependence of line ratios for Na-like Xenon. Our findings offer atomic data for studies related Na-like ions.",
