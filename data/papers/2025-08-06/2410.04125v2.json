  "title": "Transverse beam instabilities in low-emittance booster synchrotrons",
  "abstract": "As the ring-based light source community is moving towards fourth-generation light sources, many facilities plan to upgrade their boosters in parallel to meet the more demanding beam properties for the storage ring, especially in terms of a much lower emittance. Concerns over collective effects have, therefore, risen, particularly in the transverse planes, since the vacuum chamber dimensions tend to be reduced as a way to achieve a stronger focusing force on the beam. In this article, we present numerical studies on transverse beam instabilities, both in the single- and multibunch regimes, in the SOLEIL II booster as an example of a low-emittance booster. We show that Landau damping is an efficient mechanism for suppressing both transverse single-bunch and coupled-bunch instabilities. We also prove that the damping in the longitudinal plane can diffuse to the transverse plane and limit the transverse emittance growth. Moreover, we have discovered that the beam can exhibit sawtooth instability at high energy and that broad-band impedance is one of the key factors in suppressing transverse coupled-bunch instability.",
