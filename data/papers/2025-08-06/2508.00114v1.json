  "title": "Unified Description of Kappa-type velocity distributions",
  "abstract": "An extension of Maxwell's original prescription for an ideal gas is adopted to derive a broad class of Kappa-type velocity distributions, encompassing both fat and short-tailed forms. Within this general framework, a physically consistent fat-tailed Kappa distribution is identified that accurately fits recent suprathermal data. In particular, a kinetic physical temperature $T$ emerges naturally from the model, eliminating the need to invoke an effective temperature $T_{\\kappa\\ell}$, as is commonly done in the literature. Finally, it is argued that only a particular value of $\\ell$ ensures a satisfactory fit to the data when the physical kinetic temperature is employed.",
