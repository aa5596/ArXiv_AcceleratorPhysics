  "title": "Experimental Demonstration of Dephasing Reduction in an Optically Guided   Laser-Plasma Accelerator",
  "abstract": "Laser-plasma accelerators offer a compact means of producing high-energy electron beams, but their performance is fundamentally limited by dephasing between the accelerated electrons and the plasma wave. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the combination of plasma density tapering and optical guiding to extend the effective acceleration length. Using a Joule-class femtosecond laser coupled into an optical-field-ionized plasma waveguide with a controlled density gradient, we experimentally achieve electron beam energies exceeding 1.6 GeV, a 40% increase compared to the constant-density case. Particle-in-cell simulations reproduce the main experimental features and reveal the central roles of delayed injection, nonlinear laser evolution, and self-focusing in enhancing energy gain.",
