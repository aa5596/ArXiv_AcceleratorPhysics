  "title": "Moderator Simulation for the Compact Positron Source at NLCTA",
  "abstract": "Positron moderation is a key part of the production of slow positrons. This paper examines G4beamline simulations of various moderator designs and the addition of a radiofrequency cavity to increase the efficiency of the moderator. A setup consisting of a 100 MeV electron beam incident on a 7 mm tungsten target, a 5 T adiabatic matching device, a 5-cell L-band RF cavity, and a single-crystal tungsten moderator leads to a 39.3x improvement in the number of positrons moderated over a common thin-foil polycrystalline moderator without the AMD and cavity. We also present a novel calculation method for determining the stopping distribution of low-energy positrons in a thin foil, modifying the Makhovian distribution with an exponential ramp to account for edge effects.",
