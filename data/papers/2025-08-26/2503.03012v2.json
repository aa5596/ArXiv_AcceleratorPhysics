  "title": "Impact of trace amounts of water on the stability of Micro-Pattern   Gaseous Detectors measured in Ar-CO$_2$ (90-10)",
  "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the influence of humidity on the performance of various non-resistive Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors, such as GEM, Thick-GEM, and Micromegas, operated with \\ArCOtwo gas mixture. The water content is introduced in a range of \\SIrange[range-units=single]{0}{5000}{\\ppmV}. It is observed that the presence of increased humidity does not significantly degrade any of the studied performance criteria. On the contrary, our measurements suggest an improvement in discharge stability with increasing humidity levels at the highest gains and fields. No significant difference is observed at the lower gains, indicating that humidity helps to reduce the rate of spurious discharges related to electrode defects or charging-up of the insulating layers. We conclude that adding a small amount of water to the gas mixture may be beneficial for the stable operation of an MPGD.",
