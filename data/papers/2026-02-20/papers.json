    "title": "Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED",
    "abstract": "QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\\textemdash Schrödinger versus Heisenberg\\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how target geometry and material influence pion and muon production from an 8 GeV proton beam, in support of target-system design for a muon collider demonstrator. A 2 m long, 0.7 m radius solenoid with a 5 T peak magnetic field is used to capture secondary particles, with the target positioned at its center. We examine how variations in target radius, length, and material affect secondary-beam yield and emittance at the solenoid exit. In parallel, we evaluate temperature rise within the target to assess material limitations and guide future work on thermal and structural survivability. The results provide initial intuition for optimizing both particle yield and target durability in muon collider front-end systems.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Frequency Shifts due to Phase Coherent Interactions in Incompressible Hall MHD Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Turbulence in the magnetized plasma is well understood to be the consequence of wave interactions. When the Hall effect is added to the minimum magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the MHD waves become dispersive and different nonlinear interactions are expected. The emergent turbulent state will thus be expected to be different. For incompressible Hall MHD we develop a reduced model for wave-wave interactions concentrating on those processes that will lead to phase coherent modifications to the linear dispersion of a given wave. We show that these special interactions provide an amplitude-dependent contribution to the linear dispersion relation, which yields nonlinear frequency shifts. The resonance-driven frequency shifts are dominant and add damping or growth to the linear dispersion. The damping/growth rates represent the nonlinear time scales for energy redistribution and can be used in conjunction with a conjecture like the \"critical balance\" to estimate the energy spectral content.",

    "abstract": "The self-modulation (SM) instability transforms a long charged particle bunch traveling in plasma into a train of microbunches that resonantly drives large-amplitude wakefields. We present the first determination of the saturation length of SM using experimental and numerical results. The saturation length is the distance over which wakefields reach their maximum amplitude along the plasma. By varying the plasma length and measuring the radius of the transverse distribution of the bunch, we find that the saturation length of SM decreases with plasma density and initial field amplitude, e.g., when seeding. The saturation length is a fundamental parameter of the instability, and these results are key for understanding SM and designing plasma wakefield accelerators driven by long bunches, such as AWAKE, or by long laser pulses for radiation production.",

    "title": "Scattering and sputtering on the lunar surface; Insights from negative ions observed at the surface",
    "abstract": "Context. Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms.   Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations.   Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference.   Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations.   Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions.",

    "title": "Low dose gamma irradiation study of ATLAS ITk MD8 diodes",
    "abstract": "Silicon strip detectors developed for the Inner Tracker (ITk) of the ATLAS experiment will operate in a harsh radiation environment of the HL-LHC accelerator. The ITk is thus designed to endure a total fluence of 1.6E15 1MeV n_eq/cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) of 66 Mrad in the strip detector region. A radiation-hard n^+-in-p technology is implemented in the ITk strip sensors. To achieve the required radiation hardness, extensive irradiation studies were conducted during sensor development, primarily performed up to the maximal expected total fluence and TID to ensure a full functionality of the detector at its end-of-life. These studies included irradiations of sensors with various particle types and energies, including the Co60 gamma-rays. Our previous results obtained for gamma-irradiated diodes and strip sensors indicate a linear increase of bulk current with TID, while the surface current saturates at the lowest TID levels checked (66 Mrad), preventing a determination of the exact TID for which the observed saturation occurs. This work presents the results coming from irradiations by Co60 gamma-rays to multiple low TIDs, ranging from 0.5 to 100 krad. The detailed study of total, bulk, and surface currents of diodes explores an unknown dependence of surface current on the TID, annealing, and temperature. Additionally, the effect of the p-stop implant between the bias and the guard ring of measured samples is shown. The observations are relevant for the initial operations of the new ATLAS tracker.",

Using the Fireball platform at CERN's HiRadMat facility, 440 GeV protons were used to generate an ultra-relativistic, charge-neutral electron-positron pair beam that propagated through an ambient RF discharge plasma. Magnetic-field amplification due to a beam-plasma instability was diagnosed using a high-sensitivity Faraday-rotation probe, supported by detailed characterization of the diagnostic impulse response. The measured path-integrated magnetic field agrees quantitatively with predictions from particle-in-cell simulations.

    "title": "Thermal Decoherence and Population Transfer of MeV Channeling Electrons in Diamond",
    "abstract": "Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\\langle100\\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures.",

In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.",

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.",

The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(θ)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.",

    "title": "Reinterpreting the sunward electron deficit: Implications for solar wind acceleration and core population formation",
    "abstract": "This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.",

    "abstract": "DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a next-generation dual-phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct-detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall-C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7 t of low-radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\\,\\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200 tonne-year run. In DS-20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress-cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS-20k cathode high-voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric-field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS-20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$ kV.",

    "title": "Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping",
    "abstract": "Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.",

The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser and a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source.

    "abstract": "We present an implementation of edge AI to compress data on an in-memory analog content-addressable memory (ACAM) device. A variational autoencoder is trained on a simulated sample of energy measurements from incident high-energy electrons on a generic three-layer scintillator-based calorimeter. The encoding part is distilled into tabular format by regressing the latent space variables using decision trees, which is then programmed on a memristor-based ACAM. In real-time, the ACAM compresses 48 continuously valued incoming energies measured by the calorimeter sensors into the latent space, achieving a compression factor of 12x, which is transmitted off-detector for decompression. The performance result of the ACAM, obtained using the Structural Simulation Toolkit, the SST open source framework, gives a latency value of 24 ns and a throughput of 330M compressions per second, i.e., 3 ns between successive inputs, and an average energy consumption of 4.1 nJ per compression.",

    "title": "Directed Nano-antennas for Laser Fusion",
    "abstract": "Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.   Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific instruments operate under increasingly extreme constraints on bandwidth, latency, and power. Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments.",

    "abstract": "Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods have achieved widespread recognition as simple and flexible approaches to model collisionless plasma physics in fully kinetic simulations of astrophysical environments. However, in many situations the standard PIC algorithm must be extended to include macroscopic effects in microscale simulations. For plasmas subjected to shearing or expansion, shearing-box and expanding-box methods can be incorporated into PIC to account for these global effects. For plasmas subjected to local acceleration in confined regions of space, a leaky-box method can allow closed-box PIC simulations to account for particle escape from the accelerator region. In this work, we review and improve methods to include shearing, expansion, and escape in PIC simulations. We provide the numerical details of how Maxwell's equations and the particle equations of motion are solved in each case, and introduce generalized Boris-like particle pushers to solve the momentum equation in the presence of extra forces. This work is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for the implementation of shearing-box, expanding-box, and leaky-box algorithms in PIC.",

In recent years, plasma wakefield acceleration has emerged as a leading candidate for achieving higher energy collisions with smaller facility footprints due to the large accelerating gradients in the plasma. This higher beam energy poses significant challenges for the final focusing system of the collider. Here, we discuss the various challenges of final focusing for TeV-scale plasma accelerators and propose possible solutions. Finally, we present the first design of a final focusing system for a 10 TeV linear wakefield collider, evaluate its performance, and discuss its shortcomings as well as improvements for future designs.",

    "abstract": "Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. A promising choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop a precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.   In this work, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm, based on the Richardson-Lucy iteration is proposed for the first time for proton CT image reconstruction. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of CTP528 and CTP404 phantoms were used to benchmark the proposed method. In the case of an idealized detector setup, using a 1 mm pitch grid, 4.88 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.66% average RSP uncertainty was achieved. The present method provides a promising proof-of-concept candidate for compromise between accuracy and speed with several further development directions.",

    "title": "A journey to ITACA: Ion Tracking with Ammonium Cations Apparatus",
    "abstract": "A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0νββ$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish \"single-electron\" from \"double-electron\" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0νββ$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{ββ}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operation in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), where electron diffusion is large. Consequently, reconstructed track fidelity is limited by diffusion and intrinsic EL blurring. We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\\sim$100 ppb) converts primary xenon ions into ammonium ions, NH$_4^+$, via a fast two-step ion-molecule process involving charge transfer followed by proton transfer, while leaving EL unaffected. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode, allowing time to determine the event energy and barycenter. For events in the region of interest, an ion sensor near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the ions. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing. Combined electron-ion imaging strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0νββ$ lifetimes.",

    "abstract": "The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.",

No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction.

Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newton's constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.",

    "title": "The Numerics of VMEC++",
    "abstract": "VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.",

    "title": "From Coils to Surface Recession: Fully Coupled Simulation of Ablation in ICP Wind Tunnels",
    "abstract": "This work presents a fully coupled, multiphysics computational framework for predicting the thermo-chemical material response of thermal protection systems in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) wind tunnels. The framework integrates a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes plasma solver, an electromagnetic field solver, and a discontinuous-Galerkin material response solver using a partitioned coupling strategy. This enables an ab initio, end-to-end simulation of the 350 kW Plasmatron X facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), including plasma generation, electromagnetic heating, near-wall thermochemistry, and time-accurate material ablation. The model captures key ICP physics such as vortex-mode recirculation, Joule-heating-driven plasma formation, and Lorentz-force-induced flow confinement, and accurately predicts the transition from subsonic to supersonic jet behavior at low pressures. Validation against cold-wall calorimetry and graphite ablation experiments shows that predicted stagnation-point heat fluxes fall well within experimental uncertainty, while fully coupled simulations accurately reproduce measured stagnation temperature histories and recession rates with errors below 12% and 10%, respectively. Remaining discrepancies during early transient heating are attributed to uncertainties in power-coupling efficiency, equilibrium ablation modeling, and material property datasets. Overall, the framework demonstrates strong predictive capability for ICP wind tunnel environments and provides a foundation for improved design, interpretation, and planning of hypersonic material testing campaigns.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and the associated increase in non-reciprocal interaction strength are strongly correlated with the onset of structural destabilization. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.",

A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with the beam shape and distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.",

    "title": "The First Instrumentally Documented Fall of an Iron Meteorite: atmospheric trajectory and ground impact",
    "abstract": "Iron meteorite falls are rare compared to stony meteorites, and until recently no iron meteorite had a reliably determined pre-atmospheric orbit. This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events.",

    "title": "Flux pumping and bifurcated relaxations of helical core in 3D magnetohydrodynamic modelling of ASDEX Upgrade plasmas",
    "abstract": "Flux pumping was achieved in recent hybrid scenario experiments in the ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) tokamak, which is characterized by a sawtooth-free helical quiescent state and the anomalous radial redistribution of toroidal current density and poloidal magnetic flux. In this article, the self-regulation mechanism of the AUG core plasma during flux pumping is investigated at realistic parameters using the JOREK code based on the two-temperature, nonlinear, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. A key milestone in AUG flux pumping modelling is achieved by quantitatively reproducing the clamped current density and safety factor profiles in the plasma core, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dynamo effect in sustaining the flux pumping state. The dynamo term, that is of particular interest, is primarily generated by the pressure-gradient driven m/n = 1/1 quasi-interchange-like MHD instability. The work systematically extrapolates the parameter regimes of flux pumping from the above AUG base case by scanning dissipation coefficients and plasma beta. The simulation results reveal bifurcated plasma behaviours at different Hartmann numbers, including distinct states such as flux pumping (helical core with a flat current density), sawteeth (periodic kink-cycling), single crash (without subsequent cycle), and quasi-stationary magnetic island (peaked current density). Transitions from marginal flux pumping state to sawteeth are observed in long-term simulations. The relationships between system dissipation, plasma beta, and different plasma states are carefully analyzed. For practical purposes, the potential operational window for flux pumping, as determined by plasma density and temperature, is estimated. The modelling efforts advance the understanding of flux pumping and facilitate the development of a fast surrogate model for efficient evaluation of flux pumping.",

    "abstract": "The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.",

    "title": "A Doppler backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak: plasma considerations and preliminary quasioptical design",
    "abstract": "The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $ρ$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $ρ$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\\sim35^{\\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).",

    "title": "Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications",
    "abstract": "Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.",

    "title": "Systematic study of high performance GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber for SWIR and extended SWIR detection",
    "abstract": "Germanium-tin (GeSn) photodiodes potentiate a viable solution to integrate SWIR and extended SWIR detection technology into CMOS processing line. However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 μm and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 μm wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 μm at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.",

The accelerator example used to demonstrate the use of components is a circuit designed for the synchronisation of the CLIC crab cavities. This example employs co-planar waveguide, SMA connectors, Wilkinson splitters, and surface-mount double-balanced mixers.

    "title": "Code-Verification Techniques for Particle-in-Cell Simulations with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Collisions",
    "abstract": "Particle-in-cell methods with stochastic collision models are commonly used to simulate collisional plasma dynamics, with applications ranging from hypersonic flight to semiconductor manufacturing. Code verification of such methods is challenging due to the interaction between the spatial- and temporal-discretization errors, the statistical sampling noise, and the stochastic nature of the collision algorithm. In this paper, we introduce our code-verification approaches to apply the method of manufactured solutions to plasma dynamics, and we derive expected convergence rates for the different sources of discretization and statistical error. For the particles, we incorporate the method of manufactured solutions into the equations of motion. We manufacture the particle distribution function and inversely query the cumulative distribution function to obtain known particle positions and velocities at each time step. In doing so, we avoid modifying the particle weights, eliminating risks from potentially negative weights or modifications to weight-dependent collision algorithms. For the collision algorithm, we average independent outcomes at each time step and we derive a corresponding manufactured source term for the velocity change for each particle. By having known solutions for the particle positions and velocities, we are able to compute the error in these quantities directly instead of attempting to compute differences in distribution functions. These approaches are equally valid for particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions and direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations of neutral gas flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in three dimensions for different couplings between the particles and field, with and without binary elastic collisions, and with and without coding errors.",

    "abstract": "We present the development and evaluation of a real-time Graph Neural Network-based trigger for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $μ$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention. These results demonstrate the first operation of a Graph Neural Network-based reconstruction system implemented on FPGAs within the real-time trigger readout path of a collider experiment.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic-like constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a chiral bi-isotropic-like cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.",

This motivates the development of learning based surrogate models, which offer a promising route to accelerate these simulations while preserving physical fidelity. In this work, we study the Sedov Taylor shock propagation problem using a physics informed graph based surrogate model, Physics Informed MeshGraphNet (PhyMGN), designed for grid-based hydrodynamics. By incorporating weak physics constraints derived from the Euler equations using finite difference method, the model captures the self similar shock evolution and associated flow structures without explicitly solving the full hydrodynamic equations at each timestep. Comparing to the baseline MeshGraphNet model, PhyMGN is able to generalize beyond the training regime with a higher accuracy and preserves differentiability in parameter space while achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost relative to conventional numerical solvers.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.",

It combines a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board with a Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) running project-wide shared firmware and software stacks. The system architecture emphasizes reusability, flexibility, and ease of integration. The CaR board provides essential interfaces such as programmable power supplies, voltage and current references, high-speed ADCs, and configurable I/O lines for detector control and readout. The SoC runs an embedded Linux distribution built with PetaLinux and integrates two main components: Peary, a C++ embedded DAQ application providing hardware abstraction, configuration management, logging, and multi-device control through Command Line (CLI) and Python interfaces; and Boreal, a common Caribou FPGA firmware framework offering reusable modules and automated build workflows for user-specific bit files. The next major milestone in Caribou's evolution is the transition to version 2.0, based on a Zynq UltraScale+ System-on-Module (SoM) architecture.

    "abstract": "This paper presents experimental validation of the homogenized harmonic balance finite element method (HomHBFEM), which we have developed as a dedicated simulation technique for magnets with fast excitation cycles, in particular the fast corrector (FC) magnets for PETRA IV at DESY. The HomHBFEM allows efficient three-dimensional nonlinear eddy-current simulations of laminated magnets at elevated frequencies with a relatively coarse finite element (FE) mesh and without computationally expensive time-stepping. This is achieved by combining a frequency-domain-based homogenization technique with the harmonic balance FE method. The simulation results for the magnetic flux density along the axis of the FC magnets as a function of frequency and the resulting integrated transfer function (ITF) are compared to Hall probe and search coil measurements of the first prototype FC magnet for PETRA IV. A good agreement between simulated and measured ITFs is achieved for excitation frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz.",

    "title": "Excavation of a 69-m diameter and 94-m high cavern for the Hyper-Kamiokande detector",
    "abstract": "The excavation of the Hyper-Kamiokande cavern, 600 m underground, is complete. Measuring 69 m in diameter and 94 m in height, it is among the world's largest rock caverns. A vertically oriented, dome-capped cylindrical design was chosen to optimize cost and performance. Combined with substantial overburden, the geometry posed major engineering challenges. This paper outlines the underground works, main cavern design, excavation plan, and the evolution of support design and construction methods during excavation, namely the information-based (observational) design and construction approach.",
