  "title": "SASE X-ray Free-Electron Laser driven by Resonant Multi-Pulse Ionization   acceleration scheme",
  "abstract": "Laser wakefield accelerators are on the way to provide GeV scale high-brightness electron beams for multidisciplinary applications. In the present work, electron bunches are studied in the framework of a Free-Electron Laser driven by an accelerator in the Resonant Multi-Pulse Ionisation framework. The transport to the undulator is provided by a matched beam focusing with marginal beam quality degradation. Finally, using the CRESCO/ENEAGRID High Performance Computing infrastructure, 3D time-dependent simulations of the produced radiation show that about 10$^{10}$ photons with central wavelength of 0.15 nm will be delivered with the electron bunches under consideration.",
