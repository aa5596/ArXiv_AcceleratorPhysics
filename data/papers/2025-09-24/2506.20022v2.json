  "title": "Novel coincidence detection technique for precision measurement of   neutron-capture-induced nuclear recoils",
  "abstract": "The lattice dynamics following particle interactions remain not fully understood, and effects from nuclear-recoil interactions in conventional solid-state detectors - such as defect formation - can hinder accurate event-energy interpretation. Neutron capture $(n,\\gamma)$ can produce detectable, precise-energy nuclear recoils for detector calibration and solid-state physics studies. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind experiment to measure the twin products of neutron capture - the postcapture deexcitation gamma and postcapture nuclear recoil. Simulations show that with a 1 mCi californium neutron source, a positive measurement with existing detector technologies is possible in 26.1 gram-days of exposure.",
