  "title": "Delta-Doped Diamond via in-situ Plasma-Distance Control",
  "abstract": "We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.",
