  "title": "Dark counts in optical superconducting transition-edge sensors for   rare-event searches",
  "abstract": "Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.",
