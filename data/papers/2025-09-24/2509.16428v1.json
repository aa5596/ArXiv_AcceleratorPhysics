  "title": "A high-voltage MR-ToF mass spectrometer and separator for the study of   exotic isotopes at FRIB",
  "abstract": "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) delivers a wide variety of rare isotopes as fast, stopped, or reaccelerated beams to enable forefront research in nuclear structure, astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. To expand the scientific potential of FRIB's stopped and reaccelerated beam programs, we are designing a Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer and separator (MR-ToF MS). It will enable high-precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes, improve beam diagnostics, and deliver isobarically and isomerically purified beams to downstream experimental stations. It is designed to store ions at a kinetic energy of 30 keV, significantly enhancing ion throughput while maintaining high mass resolving power. We present the scientific motivation, technical design, and simulations demonstrating the expected performance of the system, which has the potential to significantly enhance FRIB's mass measurement, diagnostic, and mass separation capabilities.",
