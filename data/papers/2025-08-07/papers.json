    "title": "Development of Space Qualified Signal Processing Readout Electronics for   HabWorlds and Origins Space Telescope Detector and Arrays",
    "abstract": "The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- a flagship ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics -- will require detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across several balloon-borne missions with FPGA based systems. To transition this capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based observatories like HWO.",

    "title": "Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent   dynamo",
    "abstract": "Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, introducing a bulk viscosity into the plasma via the internal degrees of freedom of the molecular composition, directly impacting the decay of compressible modes, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes in the interstellar medium, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$, we perform trans-sonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\\rm{P}\\nu \\equiv \\rm{Re}_{\\rm bulk} / \\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$, where $\\rm{Re}_{\\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. We derive a framework for decomposing $E_{\\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\\nabla\\otimes\\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$ play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in compressible dynamos. In the absence of $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ ($\\rm{P}\\nu \\to \\infty$), $\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel}(\\mathbf{k})$ pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\\rm{P}\\nu \\approx 1$. (abridged). We emphasize the importance of further understanding the role of $\\nu_{\\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas, which we estimate could be as strong as the shear viscosity in the cold ISM, and highlight that compressible direct numerical simulations without bulk viscosity have unresolved compressible mode dissipation scales.",

    "abstract": "We present an extension of recently discovered collisionlessly damped yet topologically protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs), from a simplified slab geometry to a cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. A distinctive feature of these modes-emerging above the electron cyclotron frequency-is their collisionless damping, which arises from resonant coupling to a continuum of upper-hybrid modes localized within a smooth plasma-vacuum transition layer. We demonstrate both temporal and spatial damping of TSPWs at the boundary of a cylindrical magnetized plasma. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field, the TSPW exhibits a smooth and continuous transition, highlighting its topological robustness under magnetic inhomogeneity.",

    "title": "A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks",
    "abstract": "A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp rate is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp rates are less than the ramp rates in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp rates are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.",

    "title": "The High Level Trigger and Express Data Production at STAR",
    "abstract": "The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder, optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.   Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic feedback during operations.   This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.   The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data taking.",

    "title": "Towards a realistic noise modelling of quantum sensors for future   satellite gravity missions",
    "abstract": "Mapping the Earth's gravity field from space offers valuable insights into climate change, hydro- and biosphere evolution, and seismic activity. Current satellite gravimetry missions have demonstrated the utility of gravity data in understanding global mass transport phenomena, climate dynamics, and geological processes. However, state-of-the-art measurement techniques face noise and long-term drift limitations, which propagate into the recovery of Earth's time-varying gravity field. Quantum sensors, particularly Cold Atom Interferometry (CAI), offer promise for improving the accuracy and stability of space-based gravity measurements. Therefore, CAI has emerged as a promising measurement technique for future gravimetric satellite missions due to their potential for measuring gravitational forces and gradients with high precision and accuracy, particularly at low frequencies (sub-mHz). This study explores the sensitivity of CAI accelerometers and gradiometers to the errors in measuring the satellite's attitude. We explore the low-low satellite-to-satellite and gravity gradiometry concepts and build the respective analytical models of measurements and associated errors. We selected an ambitious scenario for CAI parameters that illustrates a potential path for increasing instrument accuracies and capabilities for space gravimetry. Two operational modes, concurrent (where a new cloud is generated while another is moved to the interferometric chamber) and sequential (where cloud generation and interferometry happen in the same place), are compared to mitigate the effects of inaccurately known attitude rates on Coriolis accelerations. The sequential mode shows the potential to reduce these effects since the atom cloud has an initial zero velocity. [...]",

    "abstract": "This Technical Design Report presents AION-10, a 10-meter atom interferometer to be located at Oxford University using ultracold strontium atoms to make precision measurements of fundamental physics. AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.   The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.   Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.   This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.",

ETpathfinder, designed as an R&D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the Leibniz-Institut f\\\"ur Kristallz\\\"uchtung. This material choice was made to pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed.

The experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented accuracy, seeking potential discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model.

Recent results from Runs 1-3 have achieved a systematic uncertainty of 70 ppb, exceeding design goals, while ongoing theoretical calculations continue to refine predictions. Despite these advances, the analysis remains statistics-limited, with continued data collection and novel experimental approaches at MUonE and J-PARC promising further insights into this fundamental physical quantity.",

    "abstract": "The Fermilab Main Injector accelerating cavities have sparking issues when they are run at voltages higher than those required by the PIP-II project. This is a problem Fermilab is working on as planning begins for the next upgrade to the accelerator complex. One of the methods being used to address the issue is the development of a CST Microwave Studio simulation to accurately model the PIP-II dual power amplifier cavities and identify which part(s) of the cavity is causing sparking to develop. The model will also be used to determine if changes to the cavity geometry may allow the cavity to be used at higher voltages before sparking occurs.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of high-power Yb-based ultrafast laser-amplifier systems has opened the possibility of air filamentation at high repetition rates >1 kHz. In this new regime, accumulation effects cannot be ruled out, therefore, characterizing the plasma parameters and afterglow plasma-chemical kinetics becomes increasingly relevant. In this work, we use optical emission spectroscopy to measure nanosecond dynamics of gas temperature and electron temperature, species-specific decay times, and electron density of an atmospheric air laser filament produced by high average power femtosecond laser at a high repetition rate of 10 kHz. The molecular excitation mechanisms behind the nitrogen photoemissions are derived from vibrational distributions and temporal behavior of the studied emission bands. The presented diagnostic technique offers a complementary but more holistic measurement approach to optical probe schemes to characterize the laser-filament-induced plasma wake for high repetition rate filaments.",

    "title": "Control of cross-beam energy transfer through laser-plasma parameter   adjustment",
    "abstract": "Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) between two lasers is investigated through both analytical theory and two-dimensional simulations, with particular attention to its linear and nonlinear evolution under various laser-plasma conditions over timescales from several hundred picoseconds to one nanosecond. Based on the dispersion relation of stimulated Brillouin scattering driven by two laser beams, we obtain a laser frequency difference range within which CBET occurs. In the nonlinear regime, high harmonic of ion acoustic wave (IAW) leads to the reduction of saturation level at high laser intensities ($I\\gtrsim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{W/cm^2}$). The wave breaking of harmonic IAW causes the second growth and final saturation of CBET. At low intensities, the linear saturation level slowly varies over time. Compared to Gaussian beams, smoothed lasers with speckles can mitigate CBET saturation level by reducing the effective overlap region. The maximum energy transfer is found at a frequency difference slightly smaller than the linear matching condition due to the reduction of IAW frequency induced by ion trapping. We find that the nonlinear behavior is sensitive to laser intensity, frequency difference, electron density, and ion temperature. The total energy transfer rate increases approximately linearly with laser intensity, underscoring its critical role in CBET control.",

    "title": "Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments",
    "abstract": "Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation. A faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, a coil with inductance of 491 ${\\mu}H$ and resistance of 0.26 ${\\Omega}$, corresponding to a time constant of ~1.9 ms, is driven so that its current faithfully follows the control signals from -1A to +1A. Capable of completing a full-scale transition in just ~31 ${\\mu}s$, with an effective bandwidth of 15.2 kHz. This corresponds to an improvement by a factor of more than 20 in both bandwidth and switching speed over a conventional power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, both the bandwidth and the switching time can be tuned to match specific needs within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.",

    "title": "Non-linear MHD modelling of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade",
    "abstract": "Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigation system in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency and prompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations, while additional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution and radiation property of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., a collisional-radiative model is used. Neon fraction scans between 0 - 10% are performed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is abruptly lost, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the neon fraction. In the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiation plays a dominant role. In case of pure deuterium injection, this second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\\sim $20%) of the total material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets ($\\leq 0.12\\%$) due to the full thermal collapse of the plasma occurring later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetration speed are then numerically studied, showing that slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker.",

An aluminum mockup cavity, replicating a 2.6 GHz Nb SRF cavity geometry, was utilized to optimize the deposition parameters, resulting in co-sputtered Nb-Sn films with Sn content of 32 - 42 at. % on the beam tubes and equator positions. Several annealing conditions were investigated to improve the surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn film. The best co-sputtered Nb-Sn film was achieved after annealing at 600 C for 6 h, followed by annealing at 950 C for 1 h. The best process was applied to a Nb cavity, which was RF tested in cryogenic dewar. RF testing of the Nb3Sn-coated cavity demonstrated the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) close to the highest reported, achieving a Tc of 17.78 K. The Nb3Sn cavity underwent a light Sn recoating process, followed by additional RF testing, resulting in enhancement of the RF performance of the cavity, primarily due to the improved surface homogeneity of the Nb3Sn coating.",

Yet, the scan rate of sSNOM remains a bottleneck to record protein structural changes in aqueous solution on the seconds time scale. We designed an optical and mechanical system consisting of a separate scan high-speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM) coupled to the BI-sSNOM optics. The designed AFM scanner has a mechanical bandwidth of ca 70 kHz along the Z-axis, and ca 6 kHz along the XY-axis, equivalent to the sample scanning HS-AFM. The AFM performance is demonstrated by imaging actin filaments. The optical design is validated by sSNOM experiments on purple membranes and microtubules.",

    "title": "Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole   Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra",
    "abstract": "The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles. The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions. Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA), computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation. This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators, this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both alternatives.",

    "abstract": "A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on diagnostic data is of crucial importance to physics experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June 2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with minimal modification.",

Hybrid numerical simulations show that in a system whose dimensions are close to the ion Larmor radius, more intense interaction dynamics are observed, the magnetic arch experiences a significant expansion with the formation of a region with an irregular character of magnetic lines, in which magnetic reconnection processes occur. In this case, the generation of a surface wave of the ion-cyclotron range is observed at the boundaries of the arch. An increase in the scale of the system compared to the ion Larmor radius leads to a transition to the ideal MHD regime, in which the evolution of the arch occurs much more slowly, and the development of instabilities is not observed.",

    "title": "Commissioning of the NUCLEUS Experiment at the Technical University of   Munich",
    "abstract": "The NUCLEUS experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of reactor antineutrinos on CaWO$_4$ targets in the fully coherent regime, using gram-scale cryogenic calorimeters. The experimental apparatus will be installed at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, in the vicinity of two 4.25 GW$_{\\text{th}}$ reactor cores. This work presents results from the commissioning of an essential version of the experiment at the shallow Underground Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich. For the first time, two cryogenic target detectors were tested alongside active and passive shielding systems. Over a period of two months all detector subsystems were operated with stable performance. Background measurements were conducted, providing important benchmarks for the modeling of background sources at the reactor site. Finally, we present ongoing efforts to upgrade the detector systems in preparation for a technical run at Chooz in 2026, and highlight the remaining challenges to achieving neutrino detection.",

    "abstract": "The detection of a single quantum of energy with high efficiency and a low false positive rate is of considerable scientific interest, from serving as single quantum sensors of optical and infra-red photons to enabling the direct detection of low-mass dark matter. We confirm our initial experimental demonstration of magnetic avalanches induced by scattering of quanta in single-molecule magnet (SMM) crystals made of Mn$_{12}$-acetate, establishing the use of SMMs as particle detectors for the first time. Although the current setup has an energy threshold in the MeV regime, our results motivate the exploration of a wide variety of SMMs whose properties could allow for detection of sub-eV energy depositions.",

    "title": "Gyrotropy-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Erosion Hot Spots on Antenna   Limiters during High-Power Tokamak RF Operation: Mechanisms and Mitigation   Strategies",
    "abstract": "Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control (which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\\sim$3 and reducing total erosion by a factor of $\\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust, reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.",

    "abstract": "Cryogenic calorimeters for low-mass dark matter searches have achieved sub-eV energy resolutions, driving advances in both low-energy calibration techniques and our understanding of detector physics. The energy deposition spectrum of gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV) detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0 V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical photons. The comparison indicates that the detector response at 0 V is about 30% weaker than expected, highlighting challenges in detector response modeling for low-mass dark matter searches.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for imposing quasineutrality and, more generally, charge density conservation in the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) and Vlasov-Amp\\`ere (VA) systems, which describe electrostatic plasma dynamics, by applying the Dirac theory of constraints. Leveraging the Hamiltonian field formulations of the VP and VA models, we construct generalized Dirac brackets using the Dirac algorithm. The resulting constrained systems enforce charge density conservation, and consequently quasineutrality, through new advection terms in the Vlasov equations involving generalized-force terms, while the electric field is eliminated from the constrained Vlasov dynamics. To verify charge density conservation we conduct one-dimensional numerical experiments using a semi-Lagrangian method, demonstrating that the enforcement of the quasineutrality constraint significantly modifies the dynamics. This approach enables us to identify the forces required to enforce quasineutrality, offering a systematic way to assess the validity of the quasineutral approximation across different kinetic scales.",

    "abstract": "Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.",

TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.",

    "title": "Mechanical strength investigations of the APPLE-X undulator using Fiber   Bragg Grating strain measurements",
    "abstract": "The SPARC_LAB facility at the INFN LNF is being upgraded to accommodate a new user facility as part of the SABINA project. It was set up to investigate the feasibility of an ultra-brilliant photoinjector and to perform FEL experiments. The new beamline is equipped with three APPLE-X undulators acting as amplifiers to deliver IR/THz radiation with photon pulses in the ps range, with energy of tens of uJ, and with linear, circular, or elliptical polarization. The APPLE-X guarantees to vary the gap amplitude between the magnets arrays and their relative phase. The entire system has been designed from scratch, and a structural analysis has been carried out. Once they were in Frascati, in collaboration with ENEA, a further investigation campaign was launched on the mechanical, using strain measurements based on optical methods. FBG sensors were suitable for these tests due to their immunity to electromagnetic noise. They consist of a phase grating inscribed in the core of a single-mode fiber, whose Bragg-diffracted light propagates back along the fiber. If bonded to the mechanical structure, they can be used as strain sensors. By following the variations in the scattered spectrum, it is possible to perform strain measurements. Using multiple FBGs applied at selected locations on the undulator, several measurements were while opening and closing the gap or changing the phase, but also by studying the quiescent response as a function of the ambient temperature. The results of these tests show that there is a clear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and magnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the tolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are compatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements methods. The tests confirm the reliability of the mechanical structure.",

    "abstract": "We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.",

    "title": "Scalable Chrysopoeia via $(n, 2n)$ Reactions Driven by Deuterium-Tritium   Fusion Neutrons",
    "abstract": "A scalable approach for chrysopoeia - the transmutation of base metals into gold - has been pursued for millennia. While there have been small-scale demonstrations in particle accelerators and proposals involving thermal neutron capture, no economically attractive approach has yet been identified. We show a new scalable method to synthesize stable gold $\\left( \\mathrm{^{197}Au} \\right)$ from the abundant mercury isotope $\\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ using $(n, 2n)$ reactions in a specialized neutron multiplier layer of a fusion blanket. Reactions are driven by fast $14\\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ neutrons provided by a deuterium-tritium fusion plasma, which are uniquely capable of enabling the desired reaction pathway at scale. Crucially, the scheme identified here does not negatively impact electricity production, and is also compatible with the challenging tritium breeding requirements of fusion power plant design because $(n, 2n)$ reactions of $\\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ drive both transmutation and neutron multiplication. Using neutronics simulations, we demonstrate a tokamak with a blanket configuration that can produce $\\mathrm{^{197}Au}$ at a rate of about 2t/$\\mathrm{GW_{th}}$/yr. Implementation of this concept allows fusion power plants to double the revenue generated by the system, dramatically enhancing the economic viability of fusion energy.",

    "title": "AI-Assisted Object Condensation Clustering for Calorimeter Shower   Reconstruction at CLAS12",
    "abstract": "Several nuclear physics studies using the CLAS12 detector rely on the accurate reconstruction of neutrons and photons from its forward angle calorimeter system. These studies often place restrictive cuts when measuring neutral particles due to an overabundance of false clusters created by the existing calorimeter reconstruction software. In this work, we present a new AI approach to clustering CLAS12 calorimeter hits based on the object condensation framework. The model learns a latent representation of the full detector topology using GravNet layers, serving as the positional encoding for an event's calorimeter hits which are processed by a Transformer encoder. This unique structure allows the model to contextualize local and long range information, improving its performance. Evaluated on one million simulated $e+p$ collision events, our method significantly improves cluster trustworthiness: the fraction of reliable neutron clusters, increasing from 8.98\\% to 30.65\\%, and photon clusters, increasing from 51.10\\% to 63.64\\%. Our study also marks the first application of AI clustering techniques for hodoscopic detectors, showing potential for usage in many other experiments.",

    "abstract": "We present a finite-temperature study of Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics, following electron-proton plasmas through one- and two-loop order with dimensional regularisation and hard-thermal-loop resummation. The higher-derivative operator is found to generate no new ultraviolet divergences; all counter-terms reduce to the single photon wave-function factor of ordinary QED. The static inter-particle force acquires a double-Yukawa profile, the familiar Debye term plus an opposite-signed contribution from the heavy Podolsky pole that removes the Coulomb singularity at sub-femtometre distances, providing an intrinsic ultraviolet completion of electrostatics. Gauge symmetry drives the transverse photon self-energy to zero at vanishing momentum, so no magnetic screening mass appears at any perturbative order. In a covariantly constant background the full two-loop sunset diagram yields a single, dimension-eight operator suppressed by T^2/M^2, implying permille-level shifts in thermodynamic quantities for realistic plasmas. The exact Debye mass and a leading-log calculation show the dc electrical conductivity exceeds its QED value by less than 10^-4. Conditions for observable Podolsky plasmons and cosmological constraints are identified, supplying precise benchmarks for future strong-field, collider and lattice investigations.",

    "abstract": "We analyze beam-induced depolarizing effects in the hydrogen jet target (HJET) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) that has been used for absolute hadron beam polarimetry and shall be employed at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC's higher bunch repetition frequencies and shorter bunch durations shift beam harmonics to frequencies that can resonantly drive hyperfine transitions in hydrogen, threatening to depolarize the target atoms. Using frequency-domain analysis of beam harmonics and hyperfine transition frequencies, we establish a photon emission threshold above which beam-induced fields are too weak to cause significant depolarization. For EIC injection (\\SI{23.5}{\\GeV}) and flattop (\\SI{275}{\\GeV}), beam-induced depolarization through the bunch structure renders operation at the current RHIC magnetic guide field at the target of $B_0 = \\SI{120}{\\milli\\tesla}$ untenable. Increasing the magnetic guide field at the target to $B_0 \\approx \\SI{400}{\\milli\\tesla}$ moves all hyperfine transition frequencies to at least three times the cutoff frequency, ensuring reliable absolute beam polarimetry with the required 1\\% precision at the EIC.",

    "abstract": "High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors have been golden standard for gamma spectrometry in Low level radioactive waste (LLW) analysis; however, their notable shortcoming is prolonged measurement durations for weak radioactive waste materials. The present study aimed to develop the HPGe Compton Net, a 1D Physics Guided CNN to accelerate LLW analysis by taking advantage of the entire response function of a HPGe detector for each radionuclide of interest, in contrast to the traditional methods that analyze only peak regions of the response. This acceleration is supported by two core innovative strategies: (a) Channel Prompt method, a feature enhancement incorporating additional physical information to guide the model to locate the designated radionuclide; (b) the specially designed database to achieve effective targeted feature learning. The performance evaluation carried out for test data set showed a five times reduction in measurement time compared to a conventional spectral analysis method while maintaining comparable precision. Compton perturbation tests confirmed the model's smart adaptive utilization of the Compton regions. The generalization testing of four LLW samples as the external validation set proved its superior performance in low count data with an average accuracy of 90% over 83% of the traditional method. Future work will focus on upgrading the HPGe Compton Net for practical applications.",

    "title": "Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating   Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider",
    "abstract": "The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.   The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.",

    "abstract": "A computational approach for predicting the number of topological interface modes (TIMs) in hermitian systems using the spectral flow - monopole (SFM) correspondence is presented. The number of TIMs is determined by calculating the Chern number of a complex line bundle of local polarisation vectors over a phase space sphere surrounding a Weyl point. The Chern number is computed by constructing the simplicial first Chern class of a discrete vector bundle on a simplicial mesh. This approach is gauge invariant, derivative free, structure preserving, and robust to noise. The algorithm is shown to reproduce the expected number of TIMs for the case of equatorial fluid waves and the topological Langmuir cyclotron wave. The possibility of using this algorithm to analyse experimental measurements of bulk wave polarisations and predict the associated number of TIMs is explored in a synthetic example.",

    "abstract": "The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \\`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.",

However, drawbacks such as power consumption, data volume, and bandwidth limit their use in the next generation of high-energy physics experiments. Time-over-threshold (ToT) systems offer simplicity, low power consumption, easy integrability, and wide bandwidth, but they lack precision, linearity, and dynamic range.

These coefficients were derived using three different approaches based on the large-scale magnetic field $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$, turbulent velocity $\\mathbf{u}$, and turbulent magnetic field $\\mathbf{b}$, yielding $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{bb+jb}}$.

We then reproduced the $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ field and compared the results with the DNS data. In the kinematic regime, where $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ is weak, all models exhibit good agreement with the DNS results. However, in the nonlinear regime, the $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ field, reproduced using $\\beta_{\\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, deviates from the DNS and exhibits unbounded growth. To address this discrepancy, we added $\\beta_{\\mathrm{bb+jb}}$, which represents the contribution of turbulent magnetic fields, to $\\beta_{\\mathrm{vv-vw}}$. This addition suppresses the divergent growth of $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ in the nonlinear regime. We then assessed the actual influence of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ on the evolution of $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ by applying weighted combinations of the two coefficients. Our results show that magnetic $\\beta$ diffusion plays a dominant role throughout the entire process. In contrast, the $\\alpha$ effect is minor in the kinematic regime but becomes essential for sustaining the $\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$ field in the nonlinear regime. We also discussed the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this behavior.",

    "title": "Evaluation of a Full Field Fluorescence Imager with Synchrotron   Radiation",
    "abstract": "The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar, two-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed for Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale prototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100 {\\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak detector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing signal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode, outputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed multi-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\\mu}W per pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308 eV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that corresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy resolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\\alpha} lines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector enables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental research. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering frame-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI ASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the (mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype correlations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced spatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt, extending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.",

    "title": "Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC",
    "abstract": "This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These models are characterized by a distinguished direction following the magnetic field around the torus, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD uses 2D, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the 3D, extended MHD code M3D-C1 uses 2D, unstructured C1 elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction and a regular grid that is partially aligned with the magnetic field. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which NIMROD does at the formulation level, but M3D-C1 uses a full 3D discretization. The resulting algebraic system is solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the M3D-C1 velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC - Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation - block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC4 disruption, and the next steps in the development of this solver are outlined.",

    "title": "Series Testing and Characterization of 1100 Hamamatsu H12700 Multianode   Photomultiplier Tubes",
    "abstract": "Both the future CBM-RICH and the recently upgraded HADES-RICH use Hamamatsu H12700 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as their photon detectors. To test the MAPMTs thoroughly before using them in the detectors, the photon sensors were qualified well in advance and a test bench was built to efficiently characterize each MAPMT. The test bench measures the single photoelectron gain, dark rate, relative efficiency, and afterpulse probability of each channel. This article describes the operating principle of the test bench and discusses the distributions of each measured quantity over 1,100 MAPMTs. Additionally, the long-term aging effects of the H12700 MAPMT are investigated based on repeated measurements of individual MAPMTs.",
