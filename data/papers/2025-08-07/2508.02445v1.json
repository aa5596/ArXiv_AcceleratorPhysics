  "title": "Gyrotropy-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Erosion Hot Spots on Antenna   Limiters during High-Power Tokamak RF Operation: Mechanisms and Mitigation   Strategies",
  "abstract": "Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control (which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\\sim$3 and reducing total erosion by a factor of $\\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust, reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.",
