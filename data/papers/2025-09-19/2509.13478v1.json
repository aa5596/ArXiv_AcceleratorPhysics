  "title": "Measurements of the Beam Longitudinal Properties in the Fermilab Linac",
  "abstract": "The Fermilab Linac delivers 400MeV, 25mA H$^-$; beam. The longitudinal bunch parameters are reconstructed using a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM) installed in the middle of the Linac. For that, the bunch length is measured as a function of the phase of an upstream cavity and fitted to simulations. The cavity gradient and its phase with respect to the beam are recovered from readings of Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). Since the cavity provides a significant transverse defocusing, the BSM measurements are correlated with transverse beam size measurements by a wire scanner (WS). Simulations connect these three types of measurements, allowing to deduce the longitudinal emittance and Courant-Snyder parameters.",
