  "title": "Power coupled to the slow wave resonance cone in cold plasma",
  "abstract": "We consider the power coupled to the plasma from a cylindrical source emitting resonance cones, propagative slow waves which exist in low density magnetized plasmas when the signs of the Stix parameters S and P differ. In this work, we calculate this power for the first time for any collisionality, and show that it remains finite in the cold collisionless limit, even as the radiofrequency electric field itself, and the associated power absorption density, is singular. We give the main parameter dependencies of the coupled power.",
