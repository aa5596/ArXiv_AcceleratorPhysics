  "title": "The growth of magnetic energy during the nonlinear phase of the subsonic   and supersonic small-scale dynamo",
  "abstract": "Small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. Theory predicts nonlinear magnetic energy growth $E_\\mathrm{mag} \\propto t^{p_\\mathrm{nl}}$, but this scaling has not been tested across flow regimes. Using a large ensemble of SSD simulations spanning sub- to supersonic turbulence, we find linear growth ($p_\\mathrm{nl} = 1$) in subsonic flows and quadratic growth ($p_\\mathrm{nl} = 2$) in supersonic flows. In all cases, we find a dynamo efficiency of $\\sim 1/100$ and a duration $\\Delta t \\approx 20\\,t_0$, with $t_0$ the turnover time, establishing the universal timescales and efficiencies of the nonlinear SSD across astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.",
