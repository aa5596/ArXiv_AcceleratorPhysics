  "title": "Study of a Compact Device for Water Attenuation Length Measurements",
  "abstract": "This study presents the development and validation of a compact device for measuring the water attenuation length (WAL), utilizing photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), optical fibers, and LEDs. An 8 m water tank and the device was constructed and validated in the laboratory. The device is capable of measuring WAL values up to 50 m. The stray light was blocked mainly by a custom-designed shutter. Toy Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the measurement uncertainty, which was found to be within reasonable limits. These simulations further indicate that the uncertainty can be reduced and more accurately predicted for a larger-scale device with a length of 30 m. Real-time monitoring was achieved by integrating the device into a water purification circulation system, providing a practical, scalable solution for WAL measurement in future large-scale water Cherenkov detectors.",
