  "title": "Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible   dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics",
  "abstract": "The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) extend the equations of incompressible Hall MHD (HMHD) by retaining finite-electron inertia. These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\\bf V} = \\wh{\\sf z}\\btimes\\nabla\\phi + V_{z}\\,\\wh{\\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\\bf B} = \\nabla\\psi\\btimes\\wh{\\sf z} + B_{z}\\,\\wh{\\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \\partial\\psi/\\partial y, B_{y} = -\\,\\partial\\psi/\\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\\phi,\\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.",
