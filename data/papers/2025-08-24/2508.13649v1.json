  "title": "Impulsive excitation of a solid by extreme contrast, high intensity   femtosecond laser pulses",
  "abstract": "We present the ultra-fast dynamics of the interaction between a high-intensity extreme contrast (expected to be around 1e-18 at hundreds of picoseconds timescale) femtosecond laser and a solid. Simultaneous measurements of probe Doppler spectrometry and reflectivity in pump-probe experiments reveal the presence of extreme pressure in the solid density region, which triggers a long-lived (about 15 ps) strong inward shock. Hydrodynamic simulations accurately replicate these observations, providing a detailed explanation of the underlying physics",
