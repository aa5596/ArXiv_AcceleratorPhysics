  "title": "Magnetic shear effects on ballooning turbulence in the boundary of   fusion devices",
  "abstract": "The effect of magnetic shear on ballooning-driven plasma edge turbulence is studied through nonlinear simulations complemented by linear numerical and analytical investigations. Nonlinear, 3D, global, flux-driven simulations using the GBS code show that the scale separation between radial, x, and poloidal, y, size of turbulent eddies, kx << ky , considered by Ricci et al. (2008) and extensively used to predict pressure gradient lengths, SOL width, particle and heat fluxes, is observed with high magnetic shear. In contrast, for low magnetic shear, kx ~ ky is observed, with fluctuation properties resembling those shown by recent low-shear stellarator simulations reported in Coelho et al. (2024a). Global linear investigations of the ballooning mode qualitatively captures the transition in mode structure with varying magnetic shear, showing that kx << ky is achieved with sufficiently strong poloidal mode coupling enhanced by increasing magnetic shear, resistivity, toroidal mode number, and equilibrium gradient scale length. This is confirmed by an analytical study considering a dominant poloidal mode and its sidebands, which highlights that the poloidal mode structure is determined by curvature and k parallel effects",
