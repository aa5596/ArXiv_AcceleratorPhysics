  "title": "Frequency conversion in topological plasmonic THz photo-mixer",
  "abstract": "We propose an alternative explanation for the observed coherent down-conversion in a laser-enabled plasmonic photo-mixer involving infrared, millimeter-wave, microwave photons. We will offer a path toward full experimental characterization of the device.",
