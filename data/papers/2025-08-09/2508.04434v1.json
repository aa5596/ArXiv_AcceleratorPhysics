  "title": "Explanation of the seasonal variation of cosmic multiple muon events   observed with the NOvA Near Detector",
  "abstract": "The flux of cosmic ray muons at the Earth's surface exhibits seasonal variations due to changes in the temperature of the atmosphere affecting the production and decay of mesons in the upper atmosphere. Using data collected by the NOvA Near Detector during 2018--2022, we studied the seasonal pattern in the multiple-muon event rate. The data confirm an anticorrelation between the multiple-muon event rate and effective atmospheric temperature, consistent across all the years of data. Previous analyses from MINOS and NOvA saw a similar anticorrelation but did not include an explanation. We find that this anticorrelation is driven by altitude--geometry effects as the average muon production height changes with the season. This has been checked with a CORSIKA cosmic ray simulation package by varying atmospheric parameters, and provides an explanation to a longstanding discrepancy between the seasonal phases of single and multiple-muon events.",
