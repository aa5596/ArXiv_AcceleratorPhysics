    "title": "Collisional passing alpha energy transport in nearly quasisymmetric stellarators",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in stellarator optimization have found nearly precise quasisymmetric configurations. These are expected to reduce the non-turbulent background plasma transport to acceptable neoclassical levels while removing nearly all collisionless direct orbit losses of alpha particles. Yet, alpha particles under resonant conditions can be very sensitive to collisions, causing concerning energy losses and damaging plasma facing components. For the passing alphas such resonances can happen near rational surfaces in the presence of helical error field departures from quasisymmetry that change the magnetic field direction and magnitude. The cancellation between streaming motion and tangential drift of the alphas enhances the effective collision frequency, allowing the formation of a collisional boundary layer and giving rise to a perturbed distribution function. We develop an analytical model to illustrate and evaluate the resonant plateau transport this mechanism causes by formulating a drift kinetic treatment. The results indicate the associated energy losses can become significant in the vicinity of rational surfaces at values of q=m/n when error fields with poloidal and toroidal numbers m and n are present. In addition, we investigate the validity of the quasilinear approximation to the energy flux to show that it imposes a restriction on the error field amplitude that can be considered.",

    "abstract": "We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.",

    "abstract": "All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.",

Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system.",

    "title": "GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes",
    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\\,μ\\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\\,μ\\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\\,μ\\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\\,μ\\text{m}$.   Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.",

    "title": "Self-Error Correcting Method for Magnetic-Array-Type Current Sensors in Multi-Core Cable Applications",
    "abstract": "Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method.",

    "abstract": "Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.",

    "abstract": "For the angular radiation patterns of proton, deuteron or alpha emission we present a way using particle-in-cell simulation of laser induced nanoplasmonic fusion. The differential Hanbury-Brown and Twiss analysis is widely used in astrophysics and in relativistic heavy ion physics to determine the source size of emitted particles. Here, we show how this method could be adopted for inertial confinement fusion. This method aims to determine the parameters of emitted nuclei after the fusion target ignition. In addition to spatial volume, the method can detect specific space-time correlation patterns connected to the collective flow post-ignition. In the NAPLIFE project our aim is to avoid thermalization and fluidization as much as possible at each stage of the fusion process. As the original laser beam is non-thermal and not equilibrated in any way it is obvious that we can minimize energy loss if we exploit the initial available energy in a non-thermal way. The detailed dynamics of deuterium and alpha production is not aimed at and not addressed by this paper.",

    "title": "Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems",
    "abstract": "A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.",

    "title": "The influence of Parker spiral on the reflection-driven turbulence",
    "abstract": "The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.",

To make optimal use of this innovative detector, new and original algorithms are being devised. A dedicated reconstruction framework, The Iterative Clustering (TICL), is being developed within the CMS Software (CMSSW). This new framework is designed to fully exploit the high spatial resolution and precise timing information provided by HGCAL. Several key ingredients of the object reconstruction chain already rely on Machine Learning (ML) techniques and their usage is expected to further develop in the future. The existing reconstruction strategies will be presented stressing the role played by ML techniques to exploit the information provided by the detector. The areas where ML techniques are expected to play a role in the future developments will be also discussed.",

For this purpose, we expand quantum kinetic equations using weak fields and slow temporal scales as expansion parameters. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the Dirac field can be described by classical-like distribution functions for electrons and positrons, which are weakly coupled through quantum interactions. Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles.

    "title": "Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria",
    "abstract": "The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints. For a cubic temperature the equilibrium has an analytic solution which is investigated.",

    "title": "Optimization of gain uniformity in thermal bonding Micromegas for the PandaX-III experiment",
    "abstract": "Micro-pattern gas detectors (MPGDs) are widely utilized in physics experiments owing to their excellent spatial resolution and high-rate capabilities. Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications.",

It reformulates the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system into a compact eigenvalue problem, enabling direct computation of multiple wave branches and unstable modes without iterative initial-value searches. Key innovations include a unified framework supporting product-bi-kappa, kappa-Maxwellian, bi-Maxwellian, and hybrid distributions with multi-component and loss-cone features; a concise rational-form eigenvalue formulation; and a 2--3 times reduction in matrix dimensions compared to the BO-KM solver, with improved efficiency at larger kappa indices. Benchmark tests confirm accurate reproduction of standard kinetic results and efficient resolution of waves and instabilities. BO-PBK thus provides a computationally efficient tool for wave and stability analysis in space and laboratory plasmas.",

    "title": "FGE: A Fast Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive Solver",
    "abstract": "Accurate and rapid simulation of the free boundary tokamak plasma equilibrium evolution is essential for modern plasma control, stability analysis, and scenario development. This paper presents the Free-Boundary Grad-Shafranov Evolutive (FGE) code, a highly flexible and control-oriented solver designed to address the challenges posed by advanced plasma configurations across a range of devices. FGE evolved from the FBT and LIUQE codes and is part of the MEQ suite, sharing many of the low-level optimized functions. It self-consistently solves the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov equation coupled with circuit equations for external conductors and models for plasma profile evolution. The code implements a fully non-linear, Newton-based framework with multiple, highly optimized solver options, state representations, and residual formulations that enable rapid computation across different simulation setups. A key capability is the self-consistent integration of various 0D and 1D current diffusion equations (CDEs) to model the resistive evolution of the plasma current profile as well as the ability to model plasmas with multiple magnetic axes (Doublets). Furthermore, FGE allows to linearize the plasma dynamics around a given equilibrium to generate a state-space model suitable for controller design and analysis. Numerical studies are presented demonstrating the code's speed of convergence and validating its performance against experimental data. Furthermore, benchmarks against the RAPTOR and KINX codes for profile evolution and vertical growth rate estimates are presented highlighting FGE's capabilities for both prediction and analysis.",

    "abstract": "We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.",

    "abstract": "A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.   I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams. The present article touches the topic of getting circle on resonance limit and the deflection sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We implement in particular a time synchronization protocol based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the smartphone clock synchronisation of 60 microseconds. Using two test cases in realistic outdoor conditions, we eventually prove the reliability of a smartphone fleet to measure mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.",

    "title": "Laser-written reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit directly coupled to a single-photon avalanche diode array",
    "abstract": "To date, most integrated quantum photonics experiments rely on single-photon detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures coupled to photonic integrated circuits (PICs) through single-mode optical fibers. This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.",

    "abstract": "We report the observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on aluminum in a cryogenic Al$_2$O$_3$ detector developed by the NUCLEUS collaboration for the detection of reactor neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CEvNS) process. Data collected at the Technical University of Munich in 2024 with a $^{252}$Cf source reveal a main recoil line at 1145 eV from single-$γ$ de-excitation of $^{28}$Al and a newly observed structure near 575 eV originating from several two-$γ$ cascades. The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$γ$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $γ$-ray in the cascade. These results demonstrate the potential performance of the CRAB (Calibration Recoil for Accurate Bolometry) method for in situ nuclear recoil calibration and highlight the importance of accurately modeling recoil stopping and nuclear de-excitation times in cryogenic detectors of CEvNS and dark matter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.",

    "title": "Solitons in Quasi-Neutral non-Equilibrated Plasmas",
    "abstract": "In an experiment performed in November 2022 at the one-petawatt (PW) laser facility Vega III in Salamanca, Spain, we studied the production of several radioisotopes using the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method (M. Rodrigues et al. [1], K. Batani et al. [12]). Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -> 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Solitons drive the system toward charge neutrality. We derive an effective soliton mass of ms = (26 +/- 1) meV and a soliton speed on the order of vs/c ~ 0.06. Understanding the soliton dynamics is crucial for applications and basic science.",

    "title": "Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory",
    "abstract": "Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.",

Comparing analytic and realistic magnetic field models reveals significant differences in electron transport patterns, where radial variations in field strength lead to asymmetric transport enhanced in low-field regions. The derived effective electron mobility shows agreement with direct simulation diagnoses, and the obtained two-dimensional transport profiles provide a foundation for developing more accurate reduced-dimensional models.",

Three redundancy techniques were applied in this work to compare their impact: simple TMR, full TMR, and temporal TMR (TTMR). The simple and full TMR approach was applied in both algorithms to establish comparisons and TTMR was applied to CSMF as an improvement. The results indicate that the BWMF achieves efficient performance in terms of area and power under the simple TMR scheme, but exhibits significantly higher power consumption when using the more robust full TMR approach. The TTMR technique, in turn, offers reliable fault tolerance while maintaining a feasible balance between area and power.",

    "title": "Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition",
    "abstract": "Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.",

    "abstract": "The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\\sim60\\,μ\\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\\sim20\\,\\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).",

In this study, we use a 2D PIC simulation to examine the local interaction between the reconnection guide field and thermodynamic variables during reconnection onset in a region of initially depleted thermal energy and enhanced magnetic energy in a large guide field background. We identify critical stages of the equilibration process, characterize intervals based on whether the pressure evolution is driven by changes in density or temperature, and discuss what these intervals imply about the evolution of local heat and work density. Finally, we examine power densities associated with electromagnetic field time evolution and electromagnetic energy transfer and compare to those related to thermodynamic changes.",

We assume as in the plasma nonlinear regime that the plasma electrons behind the driver are completely expelled and an ellipsoidal cavity filled with ions only is formed. The fields are linear in both longitudinal and transverse directions, at least in the region of interest for particle acceleration, as the one produced by a uniform ion distribution within a uniformly charged ellipsoidal volume. The fields produced by the ions and experienced by a witness electron beam are purely electrostatic, being the ions at rest in the laboratory frame on the time scale of interest and it can be represented with the field distribution produced by a 3D charged ellipsoidal. The energy spread and emittance degradation has been studied by slicing the bunch in an array of cylinders and solving envelope equations for each bunch slice. The properties of transverse envelope and emittance oscillations and energy spread degradation have been analyzed together with the related matching conditions for optimal transport and acceleration.",

    "abstract": "A Finite Volume (FV) scheme is developed for solving the extended magnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) equations, yielding accurate results in the ideal, resistive, and Hall MHD limits. This is accomplished by first re-writing the XMHD equations such that it allows the algorithm to retain the use of ideal MHD Riemann solvers and the constrained transport method to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. Incorporation of electron inertia and displacement current introduces additional numerical stiffness which motivates a semi-implicit FV scheme that re-formulates the XMHD model as a relaxation system. The equations are then advanced in time using an explicit 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme with operator splitting applied to the implicit source term updates at each sub-stage. For additional numerical stability, a density-dependent slope limiter is implemented to increase flux diffusivity at low density regions where non-ideal effects become significant. The algorithm is subsequently implemented in a scalable adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. As the new algorithm retains many aspects of the ideal MHD formulations, it asymptotes naturally to the ideal MHD limit. Moreover, it shows promising results at the resistive and Hall MHD limits. This is verified against reference test problems for ideal, resistive and Hall MHD.",

    "abstract": "In the scope of solar axion searches, detectors which are able to measure low energetic X-rays with high efficiency are required. For this purpose a detector based on the GridPix technology was built for the CAST experiment at CERN. The GridPix is a pixelised readout ASIC (Timepix) with a Micromegas-like gas amplification stage (grid) built photolithographically on top. In order to reduce the detector's background level, several hardware and software vetoes were implemented.   Hardware-wise, these vetoes consist of a ring of six GridPixes around a central GridPix, a readout of the induced grid signal, and two scintillators. On the software side, multiple approaches to distinguish between background events and X-ray photons are implemented. Here, also the hardware features, like the six surrounding GridPixes, are used.   The new detector was tested in a long ($3500\\,\\text{h}$) background data taking campaign. The performance of the new vetoes was evaluated. The detector performance itself, for low energetic X-rays, was also evaluated with a variable X-ray generator using eight different energies from 0 to $10\\,\\text{keV}$.

    "abstract": "Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities and runaway electrons (REs) interact in several ways, making it important to self-consistently model these interactions for accurate predictions of RE generation and the design of mitigation strategies, such as massive gas injection (MGI). Using M3D-C1 - an extended MHD code with a RE fluid model - we investigate the effects of 3-D nonlinear MHD activity, material injection, and 2-D axisymmetric vertical displacement events (VDEs) on RE evolution during disruptions on SPARC - a high-field, high-current tokamak designed to achieve a fusion gain Q > 1. Several cases, comprising different combinations of neon (Ne) and deuterium ($\\text{D}_2$) injection, are considered. Our results demonstrate key effects that arise from the self-consistent RE + MHD coupling, such as an initial increase in RE generation due to MHD instability growth, decreased saturation energies of the m/n = 1/1 mode driving sawteeth-like activity, RE losses in stochastic magnetic fields, and subsequent RE confinement and plateau formation due to re-healing of flux surfaces. Large RE plateaus (>5 MA) are obtained with Ne-only injection ($2-5 \\times 10^{21}$ atoms), while combined $\\text{D}_2$ + Ne injection ($2 \\times 10^{21}$ Ne atoms; $1.8 \\times 10^{22} \\, \\text{D}_2$ molecules) produces a lower RE current (<2 MA). With $\\text{D}_2$ + Ne injection, a post thermal quench \"cold\" VDE terminates the RE beam, preventing a steady plateau. These simulations couple REs, 3-D MHD instabilities, MGI, and axisymmetric VDEs for the first time in SPARC disruption simulations and represent a crucial step in understanding RE generation and mitigation in high-current devices like SPARC.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale turbulence originating from microinstabilities limits the energy confinement time in magnetic confinement fusion. Here we develop a semi-analytical dispersion relation based on lowest-order solutions to the gyrokinetic equations in an asymptotic expansion in the ratio of transit (bounce) frequency to the mode frequency for ions (electrons), capable of describing two common instabilities: the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode and trapped-electron mode (TEM), in the electrostatic limit. The dispersion relation, which is valid in arbitrary toroidal geometry, takes into account resonances with the magnetic ion and bounce-averaged electron drifts, incorporates non-local effects along the magnetic field line, is valid for arbitrary sign of the growth rate and magnetic curvature, and is shown to satisfy a variational property. Several common approximation models are introduced for both the magnetic drift and finite Larmor radius (FLR) damping, with the Padé approximation for FLR effect in particular resulting in remarkable agreement with the baseline dispersion relation model at significantly reduced costs. The baseline model is verified by comparing solutions of the dispersion relation model to high-fidelity linear gyrokinetic simulations, where the exact eigenfunction of the electrostatic potential from simulations is used as a trial function, showing good quantitative agreement for ITGs and TEMs in (shaped) tokamaks as well as low-magnetic-shear stellarators.",

    "title": "Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field",
    "abstract": "We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7°$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at $μ{\\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.",

    "title": "Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multispecies Plasmas",
    "abstract": "Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.",

    "title": "Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$β$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $β\\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.",

    "title": "Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive Micromegas Detector for ENUBET",
    "abstract": "The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.",

    "title": "CryoDE: a Digital Cryogenic Detector Emulator for Microwave SQUID Multiplexed Systems",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous readout of large-scale cryogenic detector arrays relies on multiplexing schemes such as the FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) with microwave SQUID multiplexers and highly customized readout electronics. In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.",

    "title": "Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.",

    "title": "Comparison of filament properties in real-size GBS simulations and experiments of TCV-X21",
    "abstract": "A direct quantitative comparison of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) filament properties from fluid turbulence simulations using the GBS code and from experiments on the TCV tokamak is performed within the TCV-X21 validation case. This comparison is made possible by extending the open TCV-X21 dataset with 2D turbulence measurements obtained with Gas Puff Imaging (GPI), providing critical information on the size, velocity, and other key characteristics of turbulent filaments at the outboard midplane and in the divertor region. For the comparison, GBS simulations of TCV-X21 are analyzed using a dedicated synthetic GPI diagnostic that models the neutral helium-plasma interaction and emission processes and accounts for line-integration effects. Poloidal and radial filament velocities are found to be in good agreement between simulations and experiments, while the simulations overestimate the filament radial and poloidal sizes and underestimate the relative fluctuation levels. The simulations further indicate that filaments in the SOL are predominantly represented by density perturbations rather than temperature perturbations, consistent with previous assumptions in experimental analyses of cross-field turbulent transport from GPI data. The poloidal velocity direction of the filaments agrees with the time-averaged $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ direction at the outboard midplane and X-point region, but not in the divertor leg. Possible explanations are proposed and discussed, highlighting the influence of the instantaneous $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ velocity components in both poloidal and radial directions. This study provides new insights into turbulent filament behavior and contributes to guiding future efforts to improve first-principles simulations of the boundary plasma.",

    "abstract": "Interferometric contrast is a key factor limiting the sensitivity of precision optical measurements, including the laser interferometers used in gravitational-wave detection. While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations. This work provides a practical tool for modeling and optimizing elliptical-beam interferometers.",

    "abstract": "A novel, conservative discontinuous Galerkin algorithm is presented for particle kinetics on manifolds. The motion of particles on the manifold is represented using using both canonical and non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations. Our schemes apply to either formulations, but the canonical formulation results in a particularly efficient scheme that also conserves particle density and energy exactly. The collisionless update is coupled to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator that provides a simplified model for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium. An iterative scheme is constructed to ensure collisional invariants (density, momentum and energy) are preserved numerically. Rotation of the manifold is incorporated by modifying the Hamiltonian while ensuring a canonical formulation. Several test problems, including a kinetic version of the classical Sod-shock problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surfaces of a sphere and a paraboloid, with and without rotations, is presented. A prospectus for further development of this approach to simulation of kinetic theory in general relativity is presented.",
