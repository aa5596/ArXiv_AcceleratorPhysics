  "title": "Photon identification using the Hough transform in imaging calorimeters",
  "abstract": "Photon identification in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in particle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where shower overlap probabilities become significant. We present an energy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct compact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform pattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates outstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly 100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based photon identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.",
