  "title": "Timing characterization of MALTA and MALTA2 pixel detectors using Micro   X-ray source",
  "abstract": "The MALTA monolithic active pixel detector is developed to address some of the challenges anticipated in future high-energy physics detectors. As part of its characterization, we conducted timing studies necessary to provide a figure of merit for this family of monolithic pixel detectors. MALTA has a metal layer in front-end electronics, and the conventional laser technique is not suitable for timing studies due to the reflection of the laser from the metallic surface. X-rays have been employed as a more effective alternative for penetration through these layers. The triggered X-ray set-up is designed to study timing measurements of monolithic detectors. The timing response of the X-ray set-up is characterized using an LGAD. The timing response of the MALTA and MALTA2 pixel detectors is studied, and the best response time of MALTA2 pixel detectors is measured at about 2.6 ns.",
