  "title": "Site Evaluation and Cost Estimation for Cosmic Explorer",
  "abstract": "Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a proposed next generation gravitational-wave observatory that would be sited in the United States. As of 2025, CE is in its design phase, with plans to begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope in Europe. CE's reference design consists of two widely separated L-shaped detectors, one with 20km arms and one with 40km arms, each based on technology proven by the National Science Foundation's highly successful Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). There are unique challenges associated with identifying locations suitable for hosting Cosmic Explorer in the conterminous United States, not least of which is the order of magnitude upscaling of the observatory with respect to the 4km LIGO observatories. Cosmic Explorer's approach to site evaluation integrates physical, social and cultural criteria. Here we present improvements to the Cosmic Explorer Location Search (CELS) code used to identify and assess locations where CE would have low construction costs incurred by the geology, geography and topography of the land. We also report on efforts to integrate astrophysical requirements established by the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix into the site evaluation process. National-level results are presented and combined with results from a related National Suitability Analysis to provide a list of locations that are preliminarily promising for a 40km CE.",
