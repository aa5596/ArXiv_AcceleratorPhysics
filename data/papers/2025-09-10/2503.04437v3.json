  "title": "Single-photon counting pixel detector for soft X-rays",
  "abstract": "Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.   In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.",
