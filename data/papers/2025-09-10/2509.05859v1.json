  "title": "Dissociative recombination of NeH+ with low-energy electrons:   Multichannel quantum defect theory including non-adiabatic couplings",
  "abstract": "Theoretical investigation of the dissociative recombination (DR) of NeH+ with low-energy electrons in the regime where the process occurs without direct potential energy curve crossings is presented. The calculations are performed using multichannel quantum defect theory, incorporating non-adiabatic couplings between electronic states. Unlike the previous treatment of the DR of HeH+, where only first-order radial couplings A(R) were considered, our formulation also incorporates the second-order terms B(R), together with a radial density of states \\b{eta}{\\nu} (R) to describe the transition into the ionization continuum. This development uses a large number of potential energy curves and non-adiabatic couplings of NeH characterized by us previously, enabling a consistent modeling of the DR process. The resulting cross sections show good agreement with the available experimental data and fill a gap in theoretical data below 4.5 eV, where no detailed quantum calculations are currently available.",
