  "title": "Preparation and measurement of an $\\rm ^{37}$Ar source for liquid xenon   detector calibration",
  "abstract": "We present the preparation and measurement of the radioactive isotope $\\rm ^{37}Ar$, which was produced using thermal neutrons from a reactor, as a calibration source for liquid xenon time projection chambers. $\\rm ^{37}Ar$ is a low-energy calibration source with a half-life of 35.01 days, making it suitable for calibration in the low-energy region of liquid xenon dark-matter experiments. Radioactive isotope $\\rm ^{37}Ar$ was produced by irradiating $\\rm ^{36}Ar$ with thermal neutrons. It was subsequently measured in a gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXe TPC) to validate its radioactivity. Our results demonstrate that $\\rm ^{37}Ar$ is an effective and viable calibration source that offers precise calibration capabilities in the low-energy domain of xenon-based detectors.",
