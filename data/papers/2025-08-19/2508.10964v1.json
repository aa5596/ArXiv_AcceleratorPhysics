  "title": "The SND@LHC neutron shielding",
  "abstract": "The design and construction of a neutron shielding for the SND@LHC detector, which utilizes a combination of plexiglass and borated polyethylene, is presented. FLUKA simulations were employed to optimize the shielding configuration and assess its efficiency. Results indicate a significant reduction in neutron flux, ensuring the long-term stability of the emulsion films used in the target of the SND@LHC detector.",
