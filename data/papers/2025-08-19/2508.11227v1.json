  "title": "High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography",
  "abstract": "Reconstructing 4D or 6D phase space distributions from 1D or 2D measurements is a challenging inverse problem encountered in particle accelerators. Entropy maximization is an established method to incorporate prior information in the reconstruction, but it is typically infeasible in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, I review two recent approaches to high-dimensional entropy maximization. The first approach utilizes differentiable simulations and a class of generative models known as \\textit{normalizing flows}, whereas the second approach employs the method of Lagrange multipliers and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. My aim is to provide a short explanation of each method using a common notation. I conclude by mentioning several unsolved problems in phase space tomography.",
