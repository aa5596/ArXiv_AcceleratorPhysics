  "title": "The Chapman-Enskog Divergence Problem in Plasma Transport: Structural   Limitations and a Practical Regularization Approach",
  "abstract": "We calculate transport coefficients from the Chapman--Enskog expansion with BGK collision operators, obtaining exactly $\\kappa = \\frac{5nT}{2m\\nu}$, and show that maximum entropy closure yields identical results when applied with the same collision operator. Through structural arguments, we suggest that this $1/\\nu$ divergence extends to other local collision operators of the form $\\mathcal{L} = \\nu\\hat{L}$, making the divergence fundamental to the Chapman--Enskog approach rather than a closure artifact. To address this limitation, we propose a phenomenological effective collision frequency $\\nu_{\\eff} = \\nu\\sqrt{1 + \\Kn^2}$ motivated by gradient-driven decorrelation, where $\\Kn$ is the Knudsen number. We verify that this regularization maintains conservation laws and thermodynamic consistency while yielding finite transport coefficients across all collisionality regimes. Comparison with exact solutions of a bounded kinetic model shows similar functional form, providing limited validation of our approach. This work provides explicit calculation of a known divergence problem in kinetic theory and offers one phenomenological regularization method with transparent treatment of mathematical assumptions versus physical approximations.",
