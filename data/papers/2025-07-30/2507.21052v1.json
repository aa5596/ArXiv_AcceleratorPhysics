  "title": "Monolithic optoelectronic circuit design for on-chip terahertz   applications",
  "abstract": "We demonstrate a monolithic coplanar stripline platform for on-chip terahertz (THz) generation, transmission, and detection, addressing key challenges of mode purity, bandwidth, and referencing. Capacitive coupling of the photoconductive generator switch enforces pure odd-mode propagation, increases THz field strength, and extends the operational frequency range, achieving 0.05-1.4 THz. Our architecture enables fully monolithic fabrication with amorphous silicon switches, in situ field referencing, and galvanic isolation between generation and detection. Finite-element simulations and experiments confirm that suppressing parasitic modes improves signal integrity, providing a robust platform for high-fidelity THz spectroscopy, ultrafast electronics, and nanoscale quantum materials research.",
