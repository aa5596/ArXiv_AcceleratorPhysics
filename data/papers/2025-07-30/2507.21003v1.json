  "title": "Optimizing Particle Transport for Enhanced Confinement in   Quasi-Isodynamic Stellarators",
  "abstract": "Despite significant advances in reducing turbulent heat losses, modern quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarators -- such as Stellaris -- continue to suffer from poor particle confinement, which fundamentally limits their overall performance. Using gyrokinetic simulations within the GENE--Tango framework, we identify suppressed inward thermodiffusion, caused by unfavorable magnetic geometry, as the primary cause. To overcome this limitation, we design a new configuration with a reduced mirror ratio, which enhances the contribution of passing electrons to the inward particle flux. This facilitates the formation of strongly peaked density profiles, suppresses turbulence, and leads to a substantial improvement in confinement. Our optimized configuration achieves nearly a twofold increase in energy confinement compared to Stellaris, highlighting the crucial role of optimizing particle transport in next-generation stellarator designs.",
