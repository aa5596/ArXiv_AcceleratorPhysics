  "title": "Enhanced performance in quasi-isodynamic max-$J$ stellarators with a   turbulent particle pinch",
  "abstract": "Recent stellarator reactor designs demonstrate mostly outward turbulent particle transport, which, without advanced fueling technology, inhibits the formation of density gradients needed for confinement. We introduce ``SQuID-$\\tau$'', a self-fueling quasi-isodynamic stellarator capable of sustaining density peaking through inward particle transport caused by turbulence. Temperature and density profile predictions based on high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations demonstrate enhanced performance, significantly relaxing constraints on the size and magnetic field strength for reactor designs.",
