  "title": "Twinac: A Universal Framework for Virtual Accelerator Controls",
  "abstract": "We propose a universal framework for a system of virtual accelerator controls (Twinac), a standard toolkit for research institutions to design, maintain, and use a real-time, end-to-end \"digital twin\" of their particle accelerator facility. This virtual counterpart will mirror any physical accelerator to provide (1) predictive maintenance; (2) surveillance of hidden environmental factors, such as seasonal temperature variations, which could impact performance of power supplies, magnets, and other instruments; and (3) a capability to model novel ways to operate the accelerator without risking equipment damage. Twinac is envisioned as accelerator facility agnostic, allowing institutions to share and reuse myriad simulation approaches (analytics-based, A.I.-driven, or combinations of the like) across facilities. The Twinac system lays the groundwork for a collaborative network of institutions to maintain and update this shared virtual accelerator technology.",
