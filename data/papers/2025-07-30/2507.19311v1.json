  "title": "Design and Mechanical Integration of Scintillation Modules for   SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET)",
  "abstract": "We present a detailed description of the detector design for the SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET), developed to search for millicharged particles. The experiment probes a largely unexplored region of the charge-mass parameter space, focusing on particles with mass $m_\\chi < 1.6~\\textrm{GeV}/c^2$ and electric charge $Q < 10^{-3}e$. The detector has been optimized to achieve high sensitivity to interactions of such particles while maintaining effective discrimination against background events. We provide a comprehensive overview of the key detector components, including scintillation modules, photomultiplier tubes, and the mechanical support structure.",
