  "title": "Beam Test Performance of AstroPix sensor with 120 GeV protons",
  "abstract": "AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) developed for precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium energy regime, as well as for precise shower imaging and tracking in the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) of the Electron Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We present beam test results of the AstroPix v3 sensor using a 120 GeV proton beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF), performed as part of the broader experimental campaign for the BIC prototype calorimeter. The sensor's 500 um pixel pitch enabled precise measurement of the beam profile, providing important information for calorimeter performance studies. Using the measured 120 GeV proton data, we measure the energy deposit of minimum ionizing particles and use them to extract the corresponding effective depletion depth.",
