  "title": "Attosecond X-ray pulse pairs carrying distinct topological charges",
  "abstract": "Attosecond X-ray pulses are indispensable for exploring ultrafast phenomena in matter on the \\AA{}ngstrom--attosecond scale. Especially, attosecond--pump attosecond--probe experiments could enable the study of electron dynamics in real time. Here, we advance this technique by proposing the production of double attosecond hard X-ray pulses with distinct topological charges using an X-ray free-electron laser. By leveraging transverse-mode frequency pulling, we show the formation of double attosecond pulses with varying topological charges, demonstrated by three-dimensional simulations. The resulting double pulses exhibit two temporally separated peaks with a delay of several hundred attoseconds. This capability opens new avenues for sub-femtosecond pump-probe experiments, leveraging both the temporal and topological degrees of freedom in attosecond X-ray science.",
