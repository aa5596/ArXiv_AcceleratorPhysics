  "title": "Manufacturing Tolerances of Non-Planar Coils for an Optimized Tabletop   Stellarator",
  "abstract": "Stellarator coils are known for their complexity and departure from planarity, along with tight manufacturing tolerances in order to achieve the target magnetic field accuracy. These requirements can lead to increased costs and delays in assembly; failure to meet them can compromise the stellarator's performance. Small-scale experiments offer opportunities to develop and benchmark stellarator coil design and evaluation methods more quickly and at lower budget. In this work, we analyze precise 3D scans of the manufacturing deviations of two 3D-printed coil frames (steel, Ti alloy) and one CNC-machined coil frame (Al alloy), as part of assessing these approaches to fabricating high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils for a tabletop stellarator. The deviations are measured along the coil length, then modeled using Gaussian processes to extract characteristic length scales. Finally a statistical study of field accuracy is performed using relevant experimental parameters. We conclude that the manufacturing perturbations along the winding path from CNC-machining are almost an order of magnitude lower than those from Additive Manufacturing. Together with high overall fabrication accuracy, this allows for higher magnetic field precision and an improved assembly process.",
