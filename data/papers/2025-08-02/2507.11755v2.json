  "title": "The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere",
  "abstract": "The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.",
