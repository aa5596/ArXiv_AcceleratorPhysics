  "title": "JUNO 20-inch PMT and electronics system characterization using large   pulses of PMT dark counts at the Pan-Asia testing platform",
  "abstract": "The main goal of the JUNO experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering with a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. The 20-inch PMT and its 1F3 (one for three) electronics are crucial to realize the excellent energy resolution of at least 3% at 1MeV. The knowledge on the PMT and 1F3 electronics response is critical for detector performance understanding. A study of the JUNO 20-inch PMT and 1F3 electronics system characterization is presented using large pulses of PMT dark count at the Pan-Asia testing platform in China. Thanks to its broad amplitude range and high rate, the large pulse signals are also used to investigate the PMT after pulse response.",
