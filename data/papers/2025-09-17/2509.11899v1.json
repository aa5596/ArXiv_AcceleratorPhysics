  "title": "Multi-parameter sensing enabled by modular fibre-optic assemblies",
  "abstract": "Industry is transitioning from manually monitored components and processes to data-driven solutions. At the heart of this transformation is predictive maintenance, which relies on simultaneous, real-time monitoring of key operational parameters such as temperature and vibration to anticipate and prevent equipment failures. In this work, we present a modular approach to fibre-optic sensing, where different types of optical fibres and other wires are combined to compact, hybrid cable assemblies, customized for each application. These fibre-optic assemblies can be embedded or integrated in various settings, enabling multi-parameter sensing and the measurement of new parameters.",
