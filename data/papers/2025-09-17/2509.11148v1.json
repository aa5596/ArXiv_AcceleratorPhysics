  "title": "Simulation of radiation environment for the beam monitor of CEE   experiment",
  "abstract": "The cooling storage ring external-target experiment is a large-scale nuclear physics experiment, which aims to study the physics of heavy-ion collisions at low temperatures and high baryon densities. A beam monitor (BM) is placed in the beam line to monitor the beam status and to improve the reconstruction resolution of the primary vertices. The radiation dose and particle fluence stemming from the beam interactions with gases and detector materials affect the performance of the sensors and electronics of BM. This paper uses FLUKA Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation environment of BM detector. Radiation quantities including the total ionizing dose, 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, high-energy hadron flux, thermal neutron flux, and nuclear fragment flux are presented. Results of alternative simulation setups, including adding shielding layers inside the BM, are also investigated.",
