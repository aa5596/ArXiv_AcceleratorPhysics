  "title": "Helical Field-Driven Translational-Rotational Conversion in Conductors",
  "abstract": "A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be implemented.",
