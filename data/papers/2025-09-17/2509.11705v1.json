  "title": "Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators",
  "abstract": "The Large Particle Physics Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) established the Working Group (WG) on the Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators in 2024 with the mandate to develop guidelines and a list of key parameters for the assessment of the sustainability of future accelerators in particle physics. While focused on accelerator projects, much of the work will also be relevant to other present and upcoming research infrastructures. The development and continuous update of such a framework aim to enable a coherent communication amongst scientists and adequately convey the information to a broader set of stakeholders. This document outlines the key findings and recommendations of the LDG Sustainability WG and provides a summary of current best practices aimed at enabling sustainable accelerator-based research infrastructures. Not all sustainability topics are addressed at the same level. The assessment process is complex, largely under development and a homogeneous evaluation of all the aspects requires a strategy to be developed and implemented over time.",
