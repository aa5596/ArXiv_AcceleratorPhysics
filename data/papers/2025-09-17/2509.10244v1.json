  "title": "Technical Aspects of Plasma Operational Simulation (POPSIM): A Framework   for Data-Driven Simulation and Control",
  "abstract": "This paper reports on technical aspects of Plasma Operational Simulation (POPSIM), a research framework for data-driven simulation and control built in the machine learning framework JAX. The objective of the project is to address the extremely challenging simulation and modeling requirements of tokamak operations and control by combining simple principles-based models with data-driven models, spanning everything from power laws to new neural network architectures. This paper reports on key software and operations problems that the framework addresses, with examples from ongoing modeling activities for illustration.",
