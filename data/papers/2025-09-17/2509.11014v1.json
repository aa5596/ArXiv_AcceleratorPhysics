  "title": "Multi-Objective Optimizations of High Gradient C-band Photoinjector for   High Bunch Charge Applications",
  "abstract": "The high gradients potentially achievable in distributed-coupling C-band photoinjectors make them attractive for many high brightness applications. Here we discuss optimization results for a 1.6 cell C-band photoinjector with a 240 MV/m peak field at the cathode that delivers a 250 pC electron bunch charge. We use a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), obtaining a Pareto front of emittance vs. bunch length. We also perform MOGA optimizations including an aperture to retain only a bright beam core. We find this reduces the emittance of the final beam by more than factor of 2 in some cases. For example, we find that at a root mean square bunch length of 1.6 ps, the use of an aperture improves the transverse emittance from 120 nm to 58 nm assuming negligible photocathode intrinsic emittance. The sacrificial charge at the periphery of the electron beam removed by the aperture linearizes the final slice phase space inside of the remaining beam core. The results obtained surpass the experimental state-of-the-art for beamlines with similar bunch charge.",
