  "title": "Design and performance of the prototype gaseous beam monitor with GEM   and pixel sensors for the CSR external-target experiment",
  "abstract": "A gaseous beam monitor utilizing gas electron multiplier (GEM) and pixel sensors is being developed for the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External-target Experiment (CEE) at Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). The beam monitor is mainly used to track each beam particle, providing an accurate reconstruction of the primary vertex of the collision. Two generations of the pixel sensors (named Topmetal-CEE) were produced, with the second generation's performance improving over the first one. The design and performance of the prototype are described in the paper. Characterization of the prototype with heavy-ion beams and laser beams are presented, showing a spatial resolution better than 50 $\\mum$ and a time resolution better than 15 ns.",
