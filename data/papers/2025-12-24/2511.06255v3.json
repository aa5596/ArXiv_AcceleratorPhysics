  "title": "Beam-tracing and profile evolution for localised beams in inhomogeneous plasmas",
  "abstract": "We derive the beam tracing and profile evolution for the propagation of any localised beam with arbitrary profile through an inhomogeneous cold plasma. We recover standard Gaussian beam-tracing, with an additional PDE describing the evolution of the beam's profile as it propagates through the plasma. We then solve for generic families of solutions to the PDE using ladder operators, which can be chosen to reduce to Gauss-Hermite beams in homogeneous media. We importantly obtain an exact expression for the resulting beam profile, demonstrating that Hermite modes will generally evolve into a superposition of different modes during propagation through inhomogeneous plasmas, contrary to prior work on the subject. Importantly, this approach facilitates future analysis of the diagnostic signal received from arbitrary beams.",
