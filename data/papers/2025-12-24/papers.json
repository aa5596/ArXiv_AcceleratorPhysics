    "title": "Picosecond laser test unit for photosensor characterization at ambient and low temperatures",
    "abstract": "Accurate single photoelectron (SPE) characterization of photosensors is essential for controlling systematic uncertainties in low-light neutrino and dark matter detectors. We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\\circ$C to $+20^\\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\\sim 0.1\\,\\%/^\\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types.",

    "title": "Energy transfer from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves",
    "abstract": "Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.",

    "abstract": "We present the baseline design of the electron ring collimation system for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations.",

    "title": "Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields",
    "abstract": "Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (> 5σ) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.",

    "abstract": "We present a microchannel plate detector for compact time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) that jointly optimizes the anode geometry and high-voltage AC-decoupling network for electrically floating operation. Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.",

    "abstract": "The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $β$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \\emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \\SI{0.2}{ppm} per \\SI{1}{kV} single board and $\\lesssim$ \\SI{50}{mV} over the \\SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \\SI{0.05}{ppm} over \\SI{20}{kV}.",

By exploiting a nonsymmetrical nozzle, we increased the total charge of the electron beam by at least an order of magnitude with respect to our previous experiments using symmetrical nozzles. In addition, the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons was enhanced by a factor of two. The electrons are accelerated via the Laser Wake-Field Acceleration mechanism. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that electrons are injected via the ionization and the downramp injection mechanisms. Our measurements indicate that the demonstrated electron source is a considerable candidate for high dose, Very High Energy Electrons applications, such as radiotherapy.",

    "title": "Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma",
    "abstract": "Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.",

The facility is intended to produce high-quality electron beams and to enable future generation of relativistic vortex electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of a 1.5-cell RF photogun operating at the currently available accelerating gradient of 45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low bunch charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge effects are weak and the transverse emittance is primarily determined by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and the cathode-region solenoid field results in a robust emittance-compensated regime, yielding a final normalized emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad. To evaluate the prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we further model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The simulations show that acceleration to the multi-MeV energy range significantly suppresses free-space wave-packet spreading and preserves the initial OAM structure, indicating that the proposed test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.",

    "title": "Optimal operating parameters for next-generation xenon gas time projection chambers",
    "abstract": "The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.",

    "title": "Precise control of high-frequency ultrasounds in thin crystals for the development of tunable narrowband and directional gamma-ray sources",
    "abstract": "This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.",

    "title": "Optical parametric free-electron--photon quantum interaction",
    "abstract": "Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schrödinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.",

    "title": "Magnetically confined charged particles: From steep density profiles to the breaking of the adiabatic invariant",
    "abstract": "This study examines the stability of Vlasov equilibrium solutions for magnetically confined plasmas, derived through the principle of maximum entropy. By treating the toroidal limit as a perturbation from an analytical cylindrical solution, we demonstrate that these equilibria align well with the inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description. Using the aspect ratio as a perturbation parameter, we compute particle trajectories sampled from the kinetic equilibrium distribution, confirming the overall stability of the solutions. However, under burning plasma conditions, chaotic dynamics emerge for particles with supra-thermal and even thermal energies. This destroys the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment. The exact consequences are unclear, but they could undermine the foundational assumptions of gyrokinetic modelling in burning plasmas. Nevertheless, these results suggest the possibility of unaccounted transport losses in future burning plasma operations. The interplay between turbulence and energetic particles in the presence of Hamiltonian chaos certainly warrants further investigation.",

Employing a novel hydrodynamic model that self-consistently captures nonlinearities from electric, magnetic, and convective interactions with a minimal set of material parameters. The coupled hydrodynamic-Maxwell equations are solved via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced carriers and THz emission. The results reveal strong, tunable THz output dependent on laser (intensity, polarization, incidence angle), material (composition, carrier density, temperature), and struc-tural (layer thickness, substrate) parameters. These predictions offer verifiable guidelines for experiments and position MXenes as versatile platforms for compact, broadband THz sources in on-chip photonics and 6G communications.

    "title": "Design, simulation and performance of the resistive-anode PICOSEC Micromegas detector",
    "abstract": "The PICOSEC Micromegas detector is a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector concept developed to achieve tens of picosecond timing resolution for charged particle detection by combining a Cherenkov radiator with a two-stage Micromegas amplification structure. To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.   This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.   Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications.",

    "title": "Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe",
    "abstract": "Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\\unboldmath$λ/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.",

    "abstract": "The non-inductive current start-up by multi-harmonic electron cyclotron wave has been systematically investigated in the EXL-50U spherical torus. Significant enhancements of the driven current with increasing number of resonance layers have been demonstrated by variation of the number of harmonic resonance layers of the ECW through adjustment of the magnetic field or plasma cross section. The critical role of multi-harmonic ECW in enhancing the driven current has been experimentally verified for the first time. To explain the related experimental observations, a physical mechanism involving multi-harmonic heating, multiple reflections, and multi-pass absorption - leading to the generation of high-energy electrons via X-mode wave or electron Bernstein wave has been proposed. The current drive capacity of the first harmonic extraordinary mode of the ECW has also been experimentally confirmed for the first time. After the application of Ohmic heating during the current ramp-up phase, the current drive efficiency of ECW is further enhanced. Leveraging the synergistic effect between ECW and Ohmic heating, EXL-50U achieved a plasma current of 1 MA, with the non-inductively driven current fraction reaching 70%.",

    "title": "Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-Synchrotron-powered GeV Emission",
    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5%-20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.",

    "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

    "abstract": "Modern experimental platforms such as particle accelerators, fusion devices, telescopes, and industrial process control systems expose tens to hundreds of thousands of control and diagnostic channels accumulated over decades of evolution. Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments. These implementations achieve 90-97% accuracy on expert-curated operational queries.",

By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.",

    "title": "GRANITE: High-Resolution Imaging and Electrical Qualification of Large-Area TPC Electrodes",
    "abstract": "Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\\,\\text{m}\\times1.8\\,\\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.   We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis and rigorous procedure for determining the optimal lengths of line standards in multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration of vector network analyzers (VNAs). The solution is obtained through nonlinear constrained optimization of the eigenvalue problem in multiline TRL calibration. Additionally, we propose a simplified approach for near-optimal length selection based on predefined sparse rulers. Alongside the length calculation, we discuss the required number of lines to meet bandwidth requirements. The sensitivity of the proposed procedure is evaluated numerically via Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that the derived lengths have lower uncertainty than those from existing industry standards. Practical examples are provided for various applications, including lossy and dispersive lines, as well as banded solutions for waveguides.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the interplay between fast ions and safety factor rational surfaces is studied in a turbulent plasma via global nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Initially, the fast particles-induced enhancement of shearing structures from turbulence self-interaction is analyzed. Our study takes into account the competition between this mechanism and other fast ions effects, i.e. thermal profiles dilution and quasi-resonant interaction. We find the fast ions-induced reduction of destabilization threshold for the zonal modes to be a very efficient way to suppress turbulence. Indeed, it leads to the formation of regions where turbulent transport is reduced by 90\\% of its original value. Furthermore, an $n=m=1$ fishbone is driven unstable inside the plasma and its interaction with turbulence is studied. We find the beat-driven zonal structure generate by this mode to further reduce turbulence when its presence does not drastically flatten the thermal profiles.",

    "title": "A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders",
    "abstract": "Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as a way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.",

We design a spatially-resolved spectrometer with 2560 wavelength channels. The estimated number of scattered photons in a single spectrometer channel is much larger than unity under the experimental setup and plasma parameters of the Compact Helical Device (CHD), indicating sufficient photon statistics for single-shot measurements. Simulations of the scattered spectra show that the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 5 even under the most unfavorable conditions expected in CHD at full spectral resolution, and further improves with post-processing pixel binning. Bayesian inference applied to the simulated spectra demonstrates that the inferred plasma parameters agree with the input values within the estimated uncertainties. Comparisons between spectra generated from non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions and their Maxwellian fits indicate that deviations from Maxwellian distributions can be identified using the proposed system.",

The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of the environmental refractive index was studied by immersing the EJ-160II fiber in water. Immersing the fiber in water reduced the overall light output and suppressed the short attenuation component, which can be explained by reduced light-collection efficiency due to the smaller refractive-index contrast between the fiber cladding and the surrounding medium.",

In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations.",

We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostics provide reliable, minimally perturbative measurements of fundamental plasma parameters, such as electron density ($n_e$) and electron temperature ($T_e$). Deep neural networks can provide accurate estimates of $n_e$ and $T_e$ when conventional fitting algorithms may fail, such as when TS spectra are dominated by noise, or when fast analysis is required for real-time operation. Although deep neural networks typically require large training sets, transfer learning can improve model performance on a target task with limited data by leveraging pre-trained models from related source tasks, where select hidden layers are further trained using target data. We present five architecturally diverse deep neural networks, pre-trained on synthetic TS data and adapted for experimentally measured TS data, to evaluate the efficacy of transfer learning in estimating $n_e$ and $T_e$ in both the collective and non-collective scattering regimes. We evaluate errors in $n_e$ and $T_e$ estimates as a function of training set size for models trained with and without transfer learning, and we observe decreases in model error from transfer learning when the training set contains $\\lessapprox$ 200 experimentally measured spectra.",

To mitigate this, we present the first fully-coupled simulation of high-voltage pulsed discharges interacting with a Mach 24 flowfield. The results demonstrate that the applied electric field generates a large, non-neutral plasma sheath near the cathode, depleting electron density by several orders of magnitude over a distance commensurate with the height of the shock layer. This depletion window effectively reduces the attenuation of a 4 GHz signal from 60% to 4% with a manageable power requirement of 66 W per cm$^2$ of exposed cathode surface. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the sheath topology is governed principally by ion kinetics; specifically, corrections to ion mobility at high reduced electric fields lead to enhanced space-charge shielding and a subsequent contraction of the sheath. Conversely, the sheath structure is largely insensitive to the electron mobility model. Finally, we argue that the present drift-diffusion model likely yields a conservative lower bound for mitigation performance. A kinetic approach accounting for ballistic ion transport and non-local ionization would likely predict thicker sheaths and lower attenuation for equivalent power deposition.",

    "title": "A projection method for particle resampling",
    "abstract": "Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as particle noise hamper long time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as particle resampling. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space. This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, 3X in physical space and 3V in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a 1X + 1V Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. Stable long time dynamics are demonstrated up to T = 500 and reproducibility artifacts and data with stable dynamics up to T = 1000 are publicly available.",

    "title": "MCPlas, a MATLAB toolbox for reproducible plasma modelling with COMSOL",
    "abstract": "The MCPlas toolbox represents a collection of MATLAB functions for the automated generation of an equation-based fluid-Poisson model for non-thermal plasmas in the multiphysics simulation software COMSOL. Following the development of the new generation of the LXCat platform, all input data are prepared in a structured and interoperable JSON format and can be supplied and validated using existing JSON schemas. The toolbox includes fully transparent, editable MATLAB source code and offers an advanced description of electron transport in addition to commonly used approaches in the plasma modelling community. It supports one-dimensional and two-dimensional modelling geometries employing Cartesian, polar and cylindrical coordinate systems. MCPlas is tested on two reference cases: DC- and RF-driven low-pressure glow discharges in argon. Comparison of MCPlas results with results obtained by employing COMSOL's Plasma Module verifies the reliability of the plasma model implemented by MCPlas and demonstrates the significance of electron transport treatment and boundary conditions applied in the toolbox. Using the same examples, the easy handling of complex reaction kinetic models in MCPlas and the reusability of its JSON input data across different modelling platforms are illustrated. This demonstrates that MCPlas provides a transparent and reproducible workflow for the simulation of non-thermal plasmas using COMSOL.",

    "abstract": "Edge fluid modeling of the first divertor-plasma detachment experiments in negative triangularity discharges on DIII-D is presented using the 2D multi-fluid code UEDGE, including cross-field particle drifts. Density scans are performed to reproduce the experimental roll-over of the outer-target ion saturation current and to investigate detachment physics for both forward and reverse toroidal magnetic field configurations. Consistent with experiments, the simulations show that approximately 40% higher density is required to reach detachment onset for forward BT compared to reverse BT, and that deep detachment is not achieved for reverse BT. Comparisons with positive triangularity Ohmic discharges further demonstrate that negative triangularity requires substantially higher densities, at or above the Greenwald limit, to access detachment. The modeling indicates that the increased difficulty of achieving detachment in negative triangularity arises from a shorter midplane-to-target connection length, a reduced outer divertor leg length, and lower cross-field transport compared to positive triangularity configurations.",

    "abstract": "The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy for the generation of flow acceleration in the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the actual wind channel area via a multiplicative factor, which is precisely Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models as well as an n-dimensional (n= 1, 2, 3) underlying space for the solar wind.",

    "abstract": "In this literature review we investigate the permittivity, density-of-state mass, band gap, impact ionization, charge carrier recombination, incomplete ionization and mobility in 4H silicon carbide. We provide a comprehensive overview over characterization methods, models and parameters to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and allow a critical evaluation of common material property descriptions. We further highlight areas for future research by identifying gaps in the current knowledge base.   For each investigated property we found a large amount of models and parameter sets based on measurements, calculations or fittings. With literal and/or graphical comparisons we reveal qualitative good agreement but also flawed data values, misinterpretations of research results and inconsistencies among multiple investigations, even those directly referencing each other. We identify parameter variations, e.g., due to temperature, with high impact that are rarely considered in 4H-SiC analyses and common values that are based on old research of deviating materials or properties. We further show the slow accommodation of recent research results within the scientific community and reveal missing characterization data but also insufficient models in state-of-the-art technology computer aided design (TCAD) tools. Overall, our review enables scientifically based decisions on 4H-SiC material parameters and unravels the demand for further investigations to validate commonly used values, confirm hypothesis and cover additional dependencies.",

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a novel method to extract photomultiplier tube (PMT) calibration timing constants in large liquid scintillation detectors from physics data using the machinery of unsupervised deep learning. The approach uses a simplified physical model of optical photon transport in the loss function, with PMT calibration constants treated as free parameters, and the simple assumption that individual events represent point-like emission. The problem is, thus, effectively reduced to that of regression on a very large scale, made tractable by deep learning architectures and automatic differentiation frameworks. Using data from the 9,300 PMTs in the SNO+ detector, the method has been shown to reliably extract 3 calibration constants for each of the over 7,500 online PMTs using radioactive background events. We believe that this basic approach can be straightforwardly generalised for a wide range of applications.",

    "title": "First results of a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor with Internal Signal Gain Fully Integrated in a 180 nm CMOS Technology",
    "abstract": "Dense tracking environments in experiments at CERN's High-Luminosity LHC and future FCC experiments call for an increased use of timing information in addition to the position measurement of pixel detectors. This adds one dimension to the information available, and is essential for pile-up mitigation at high luminosity. The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors. Fast signal rise time due to internal charge amplification improves the response time and timing resolution, all of which makes such a technology attractive for future 4D tracking applications in HEP experiments. This paper presents the first results of the CASSIA sensor, a novel MAPS which uses gain layers fully integrated in a 180nm imaging process to achieve internal signal amplification. In the first measurements presented here we demonstrate the gain behaviour of different pixel implant designs and show that the sensor can be operated with low gain proportional mode as LGAD sensor at lower voltages and as SPAD sensor at higher voltages.",

    "title": "Design optimization of silicon nitride nanomechanical resonators for thermal infrared detectors: a guide through key figures of merit",
    "abstract": "Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling. Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use cases.",

Targeting such applications deployed on FPGAs, we present High Granularity Quantization (HGQ), a quantization-aware training framework that optimizes parameter bit-widths through gradient descent. Unlike conventional methods, HGQ determines the optimal bit-width for each parameter independently, making it suitable for hardware platforms supporting heterogeneous arbitrary precision arithmetic. In our experiments, HGQ shows superior performance compared to existing network compression methods, achieving orders of magnitude reduction in resource consumption and latency while maintaining the accuracy on several benchmark tasks. These improvements enable the deployment of complex models previously infeasible due to resource or latency constraints. HGQ is open-source and is used for developing next-generation trigger systems at the CERN ATLAS and CMS experiments for particle physics, enabling the use of advanced machine learning models for real-time data selection with sub-microsecond latency.",

The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $μ$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.",
