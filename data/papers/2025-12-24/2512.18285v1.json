  "title": "Growth of Phaseolus vulgaris in Response to Seed Priming by Plasma-Activated Water in Laboratory Screening and Outdoor Pot Trial",
  "abstract": "This study explores plasma-activated water (PAW) effects on Common bean growth in laboratory and pot trials. Three treatments were assessed: PAW priming, spraying, and their combination. Laboratory trials showed no germination improvement. However, pot trials revealed notable increases in seedling length, biomass, and antioxidant enzyme activity. Enzymes SOD, G-POX, CAT, APX, and GR showed significantly higher activity in PAW-treated plants. These effects were linked to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in PAW. Findings suggest PAW enhances bean growth and physiology, supporting field farming applications.",
