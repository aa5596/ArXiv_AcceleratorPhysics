  "title": "In situ axion generation and detection in laser-plasma wakefield interaction",
  "abstract": "We propose a laser-plasma wakefield interaction based scheme for in situ axion generation and detection through the Primakoff process.   Strong electromagnetic fields ($\\gtrsim 10^{11}$\\,V/m) in the wakefield can enhance axion production rates by 2 orders of magnitude compared to conventional light-shining-through-a-wall experiments. By replacing the axion generation stage with laser-wakefield interaction, the axion-photon coupling constraints can achieve the level of $\\gagg \\sim 10^{-10}\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass less than 0.1\\,meV.   Besides, the generated axions can convert back into photons in the background fields, leading to axion-regenerated electromagnetic fields (AREM) with unique polarization, frequency, and transverse modes.   This provides a new promising way to search axions by detecting the filtered AREM fields from the background laser and plasma fields.",
