    "title": "Low-Energy Radon Backgrounds from Electrode Grids in Dual-Phase Xenon TPCs",
    "abstract": "The dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) is a powerful technology to detect rare interactions such as scatters of dark matter particles on nuclei. In particular, the built-in gain of ionization signals in a dual-phase TPC makes it sensitive to events in the few-electron regime, as expected from low-mass dark matter interactions. The pursuit of this low-energy sensitivity through ionization-only signal detection has so far been hindered by excessive electron backgrounds observed across experiments. Much of this background is attributed to the plate-out of $^{222}$Rn decay chain isotopes on the high voltage electrode grid surfaces that span the full cross section of the TPC. This work presents a first-principle model constructed for this background, the predictions of which are consistent with data from the LZ and LUX experiments. We then discuss mitigation strategies of this background in future dual-phase TPCs and the possibility of applying this grid background model to ionization-only dark matter searches.",

    "title": "A coherent structure transport model for scrape-off layer turbulence",
    "abstract": "Understanding the locality of high-temperature plasma energy deposition on material surfaces in fusion reactors is critical for design. Here, we utilize the Gyrokinetic ElectroMagnetic turbulence including X-points (GEMX) simulation, together with SOLPS-ITER solutions for the background equilibrium electric field including drifts, to model the heat flux at the divertor plate and characterize the heat load width using realistic X-point geometry. We use a theory-based blobby transport model called the \"Coherent Structure Transport\" (CST) model to include the effect of plasma transport in the edge scrape-off layer. The CST model is extremely fast and can be used to quickly analyze any SOLPS-ITER solution. SOLPS-ITER provides the steady state, or equilibrium on which we superimpose blobby turbulence characterized by blob size, amplitude and frequency. We obtain the $1/B_p$ scaling of the heat load exponential decay width $λ_q$, in agreement with the Eich empirical scaling and with the Goldston heuristic theory. When including blobby turbulence in combination with the SOLPS-ITER electric field, we find a secondary peak in the heat flux radial profile, outwardly displaced from the strike point radius, with a relative amplitude that is proportional to the initial blob density. We describe the CST model in detail and provide initial investigations of the scaling of $λ_q$ and the secondary heat flux peak with blob size and amplitude.",

    "title": "A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization",
    "abstract": "Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most current stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: stage-1 for the equilibrium and stage-2 for a coil design that reproduces its magnetic configuration. Because few proxies connect both stages, two-stage optimization can produce plasmas that have high-quality physical properties but overly complex coils. In recent years, single-stage optimization is increasingly used to optimize the plasma and coils simultaneously, in order to improve the plasma-coil balance. However, all existing single-stage tools are specialized for filament coils, cannot model coil systems containing permanent magnets (PM) or dipole arrays, and remain challenged by numerical problems.The quasi-single-stage (QSS) optimization finds a middle-ground by integrating a coil optimization subproblem into stage-1 optimization. We present a flexible, differentiable coil complexity proxy based on the newly developed QUADCOIL coil optimization code. QUADCOIL is fast and can target realistic coil metrics and constraints that are unavailable to codes with comparable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the QUADCOIL proxy by presenting two QSS optimization studies. The first study produces a permanent magnet solution for the MUSE stellarator with 29% fewer magnets than previous solutions. The second study produces a coil solution for the ARIES-CS stellarator with approx 30% reductions in both peak and average coil force.",

    "title": "Quantitative imaging of Abrikosov vortices by scanning quantum magnetometry",
    "abstract": "Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.",

    "title": "On Topology of Perturbed Vortices",
    "abstract": "Zero-helicity vortices, such as Hill's vortex and field-reversed configurations (FRCs), have long been assumed to be toroidal in topology. This paper proves this assumption false: even under arbitrarily small odd-parity (with respect to the z-axis of symmetry) perturbations, flux surfaces in the interior region become simply connected in topology with crescent-shaped boundaries. A new inner separatrix emerges, separating toroidal flux surfaces in an intermediate region from simply connected surfaces in the core. In a spherical vortex with perturbations at roughly 10% of the background field strength, the simply connected region occupies ~40% of the total closed-field-line volume. The analysis rigorously proves the conjecture regarding field-line closure under odd-parity perturbations in a full three-dimensional context, completing previous partial proofs in two-dimensional geometry. Preliminary numerical simulations of charged particle trajectories in field-reversed configurations revealed crescent-shaped drift surfaces even for small gyroradii. Given that FRCs are sustained by rotating magnetic fields with odd parity, these results motivate a revision of FRC-related fusion confinement physics. Furthermore, given the mathematical equivalence to Hill's vortex, this updates our topological understanding of fluid flow in a wide array of phenomena.",

    "title": "Entropy stable numerical schemes for divergence diminishing Chew, Goldberger & Low equations for plasma flows",
    "abstract": "Chew, Goldberger & Low (CGL) equations are a set of hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products used to model the plasma flows, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not valid, and the pressure tensor is assumed to be rotated by the magnetic field. This results in the pressure tensor, which is described by the two scalar components. As the magnetic field also evolves, controlling the divergence of the magnetic field is important. In this work, we consider the generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique for the CGL model. The resulting model is referred to as the GLM-CGL system. To make the system suitable for entropy-stable schemes, we reformulate the GLM-CGL system by treating some conservative terms as non-conservative. The resulting system has a non-conservative part that does not affect entropy evolution. We then propose entropy stable numerical methods for the GLM-CGL model. The numerical results for the GLM-CGL system are then compared with the CGL system without the GLM divergence diminishing approach to demonstrate that the GLM approach indeed leads to significant improvement in the magnetic field divergence diminishing.",

    "abstract": "Searches for charged lepton flavor violation in the muon sector stand out among the most sensitive and clean probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, $μ^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ γ$ experiments provide the best constraints in this field for a wide range of models while, in the coming years, new experiments investigating the processes of $μ^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ \\mathrm{e}^+ \\mathrm{e}^-$ and $μ\\to \\mathrm{e}$ conversion in the nuclear field are anticipated to reach comparable or higher sensitivities. The High-Intensity Muon Beam (HIMB) facility at PSI, which is expected to deliver muon beam intensities up to two orders of magnitude higher than the existing beam lines, offers a unique opportunity to significantly enhance the sensitivity of $μ^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ γ$ searches. The discovery potential could be substantially boosted and a sensitivity comparable to that of all the other projects could be reestablished, which is essential for discriminating among competing new-physics scenarios should an observation occur in any of the channels. In this document, we express our interest in developing a $μ^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ γ$ experimental program at HIMB, with the goal of improving, within the next decade, the sensitivity of the $μ^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ γ$ search by more than one order of magnitude relative to the expected final result of the current leading experiment, MEG II. This effort would ensure that PSI retains its leadership in this field.",

    "title": "Development of a cost-effective X-ray imaging device based on Raspberry Pi Camera",
    "abstract": "This study reports the development and characterization of a cost-effective X-ray imaging device built from Raspberry Pi components, including a high-quality 12.3-megapixel camera configured for indirect detection with a Gd2O2S: Tb scintillation screen. The device was evaluated under both ambient light and X-ray exposure conditions. Initial characterization under ambient light ensured proper optical focusing; subsequently, camera settings (ISO and exposure time) were evaluated and optimized for X-ray imaging performance. Spatial resolution of the developed device was quantified using the Slanted-Edge method to derive the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The device achieves MTF20 values of 68 lp/mm under ambient light and 25 lp/mm under X-ray irradiation (50 and 70 kV) with Gd2O2S:Tb screen. Besides, the modularity of the developed device was confirmed by conducting the tests with LYSO:Ce and GAGG:Ce screens. Results demonstrate that this compact, cost-effective platform delivers spatial resolution comparable to clinical radiography systems, with potential applications in scientific, educational, and medical contexts where cost and portability are critical factors.",

    "title": "A Low Cost Picoseconds Precision Timing and Synchronization Over A Hundred Kilometer",
    "abstract": "Large-scale systems, such as very large accelerators used for fundamental research, require the implementation of precise timing and synchronization systems over distances of several tens of kilometers. A very high precision has been demonstrated by the use of costly and complex clock distribution systems. However, many devices, such as accelerator diagnostics or large-scale detectors, only require picosecond precision. An approach exploiting the CERN White Rabbit protocol, deployed and enhanced on an electronic system capable of generating arbitrary frequencies with Hertz precision, is proposed here. Results of performance tests for the synchronization of a laser system, typically employed as a diagnostic for electron/positron beam polarimetry in accelerators, are provided in this Paper. We demonstrate that without implementing corrections for environmental changes, as temperature drifts, the system can synchronize a pulsed laser with picoseconds precision over a hundred kilometers, exhibiting drifts of a few picoseconds. This work paves the way for a low-cost implementation of picosecond synchronization of accelerator components and large-scale detectors.",

    "title": "Deuterium-Tritium Levitated Dipole Fusion Power Plants",
    "abstract": "Levitated dipole reactors offer an attractive path towards economic fusion power generation. The intrinsic decoupling of the confining magnetic field-generating REBCO magnets and the vacuum vessel offer unparalleled accessibility and maintainability, allowing for high plant duty factors and theoretically low electricity prices. In order to achieve rapid deployment of fusion power to the grid, the use of the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel cycle is required due to its lower required plasma triple products. Historically, designs of levitated dipole fusion power plants have targeted advanced fuels as a DT device was seen to be infeasible due to the high fluxes of 14.1 MeV neutrons on the superconducting core magnet. This study presents high level designs for two feasible first-of-a-kind (FOAK) DT levitated dipole fusion power plants, the larger of which produces 667 MW of fusion power and is predicted to produce 208 MW of net electric power. Both designs consist of a heavily neutron-shielded, high-field REBCO core magnet capable of producing peak magnetic field strengths of 23 T while keeping peak mechanical strains below 0.4%. The neutron shielding is comprised of a layered structure of tungsten and boron carbide, which allows for 92% of the heat deposited in the neutron shield to be radiated out to the first wall while still providing sufficient neutron attenuation to give adequate REBCO conductor lifetimes. The core magnet REBCO coil is comprised of a small \"sacrificial\" section and a larger semi-permanent section. The sacrificial section, comprising ~20% of the coil, will have a neutron damage limited lifetime of ~1 year, after which the core magnet will be quickly removed from the vacuum vessel and replaced. This allows the damaged core magnet to be refurbished and reused, reducing cost and allowing for economic fusion power generation from a DT levitated dipole reactor.",

    "title": "Rotation of a Solar Jet Driven by Plasma Flow along Helical Magnetic Fields in an Active Region",
    "abstract": "Solar jets, collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, play a vital role in energy transport and coronal heating. While rotational motions in jets are often attributed to magnetic field untwisting, alternative explanatory mechanisms remain possible. This study investigates a rotating jet in an active region observed on 2023 August 1 using multi-wavelength observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), combined with a self-consistent time-dependent magnetofrictional (TMF) model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Spectral diagnostics reveal coexisting red and blue shifts along the edges and central axis of the jet, indicating helical plasma motion within a twisted magnetic structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the jet's rotation arises from plasma propagating along helical open field lines, formed via reconnection between a pre-existing flux rope and overlying magnetic fields. Contrary to classical untwisting models, both linear and rotational velocities decrease with altitude during the jet propagation. These results highlight that the observed rotation results from plasma spiral motion along twisted fields rather than untwisting dynamics of the magnetic field itself, providing new insights into solar jet energetics and their connection to broader solar phenomena.",

    "title": "Introduction to Strong Alfvénic MHD Turbulence",
    "abstract": "Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important.",

    "abstract": "Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 Å non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.",

    "title": "Radiation damage to normal mammalian tissue in vivo with laser-driven protons at ultra-high instantaneous dose rate",
    "abstract": "The differential sparing of normal tissues relative to tumor control observed at ultra-high dose rates, referred to as the FLASH effect, has recently gained considerable attention. The therapeutic advantages of FLASH radiotherapy are expected to be further amplified through the use of protons and ions, which enable precise dose deposition at tumor depth while minimizing irradiation of healthy tissues proximal and distal to the target. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying this sparing effect remains poorly understood. Laser-driven proton accelerators are capable of delivering uniquely high instantaneous dose rates in ultrashort bunches. Here, we report the first in vivo investigation of normal tissue response to laser-driven proton irradiation. Our findings reveal a reduction in tissue swelling following laser-driven proton treatment compared with X-ray irradiations at conventional dose rates. RNA sequencing identified differential gene expression associated with immune and epidermal programs following laser-driven proton irradiations at two different dose levels.",

This upgrade requires the design of complex horizontal beam splitters to manage up to six concurrent beam passes.

The design methodology, centered on multi-pass simulations in the Bmad toolkit, is detailed from the initial geometric layout through the advanced optics matching. Key results include a robust geometric arrangement that fits within the spatial boundaries and the development of multiple, flexible optics matching solutions. Furthermore, the design integrates a viable scheme for extracting high-energy beams for the experimental halls, a critical operational requirement. This work establishes a comprehensive and viable conceptual design, forming a baseline for future engineering and performance optimization studies.",

In case we use particle beams, we need a method of distributing these beams from a radio-frequency accelerator to the different plasma stages. A central part of this is a delay scheme that ensures temporal synchronization of the drivers.

    "title": "LANTERN: Characterization technology for low threshold cryogenic detectors",
    "abstract": "The use of low-temperature detectors, such as cryogenic calorimeters, has pioneered the recent advancements in low-energy rare event searches. These detectors provide a low-noise environment essential for the direct detection of dark matter and neutrinos. Characterizing these detectors within the region of interest (ROI), typically spanning from O(10~eV) to O(1~keV), has proven to be a challenging task. Conventional radioactive sources produce signals above this range, leading to nonlinearities and saturation effects. Moreover, these detectors are usually deployed in low background environments, meaning that having a radioactive source during physics runs can spoil the measurement making the use of this type of solution unfeasible.   As a solution to these issues, we introduce LANTERN, an optical calibration system designed for highly segmented cryogenic calorimeters. LANTERN utilizes the photostatistics resulting from the absorption of monochromatic UV-Vis photons emitted by LEDs to analyze the detector response curve, without needing prior knowledge of the total energy deposited. The system employs a fast-switching LED matrix that operates at excitation times faster than the typical response of cryogenic detectors and can currently characterize up to 64 calorimeters independently.   In this work, the validation of the final electronics designed for the project is shown. The first test was carried out by calibrating one of the cryogenic detectors of the BULLKID-DM experiment and checking the energy-reconstruction error of the spectral features produced by the surrounding lead casing. An error of $\\approx 2\\%$ has been observed in the energy reconstruction. The second validation was carried out by cross-calibrating one of the CALDER thin detectors with a commercial LED driver, and compatible results between the two setups were achieved.",

    "title": "Operational Accelerator Tuning via Model-Coupled Optics and Bayesian Steering",
    "abstract": "We present an on-line tuning strategy for the ISAC post-accelerator that pre-sets machine optics with a digital twin and then performs Bayesian optimization for steering under online operation with beam. The model computes end-to-end tunes in seconds and interfaces with the control system under device bounds, slew-rate limits, and loss interlocks. We report three experimental case studies demonstrating that decoupling optics from steering yields faster and more reliable convergence than a fully Bayesian optics-plus-steering baseline under identical conditions. Across these cases, iterations to high transmission tunes are reduced by a factor of 4-6, with final average transmissions in the mid- to high-90% range. By factorizing optics from steering, the dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced, convergence becomes more predictable, and operational safeguards are easier to enforce.",

    "title": "Development of a Cherenkov-Based Time-of-Flight Detector Using Silicon Photomultipliers",
    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to develop high precision Time-of-Flight (TOF) devices based on high refractive index solid Cherenkov radiators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Cherenkov light is prompt and therefore ideal for reaching the intrinsic timing limits of TOF systems. By utilizing a thin, high-refractive-index radiator a nearly instantaneous signal is generated by particles exceeding the Cherenkov threshold. In order to achieve the ultimate time resolution, we carried out a rigorous optimization of the radiator material and geometry, alongside the efficiency of the optical coupling to the SiPM sensors. The key factors limiting the time resolution were characterized by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, subsequently validated against experimental beam test data. We assembled small-scale prototypes instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM arrays sensors with pitches ranging from 1.3 to 3 mm coupled with various window materials, such as fused silica and MgF2, featuring various thickness values. The prototypes were successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN-PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on either the Petiroc 2A or the Radioroc 2 interfaced to a picoTDC to measure charges and times. By comparing the time measurements with two SiPM arrays we were able to measure a time resolution better than 33.2 ps at the full system level with a charged particle detection efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate the expected performance benchmarks for the charged particle detection efficiency and time resolution and highlight the potential of the developed Cherenkov-based TOF detectors for next-generation particle identification systems.",

To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu.

    "title": "Spectral Deconvolution without the Deconvolution: Extracting Temperature from X-ray Thomson Scattering Spectra without the Source-and-Instrument Function",
    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) probes the dynamic structure factor of the system, but the measured spectrum is broadened by the combined source-and-instrument function (SIF) of the setup. In order to extract properties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF needs to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al. Nature Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)] has suggested that the SIF may be deconvolved using the two-sided Laplace transform. However, the extracted information can depend strongly on the shape of the input SIF, and the SIF is in practice challenging to measure accurately. Here, we propose an alternative approach: we demonstrate that considering ratios of Laplace-transformed XRTS spectra collected at different scattering angles is equivalent to performing the deconvolution, but without the need for explicit knowledge of the SIF. From these ratios, it is possible to directly extract the temperature from the scattering spectra, when the system is in thermal equilibrium. We find the method to be generally robust to spectral noise and physical differences between the spectrometers, and we explore situations in which the method breaks down. Furthermore, the fact that consistent temperatures can be extracted for systems in thermal equilibrium indicates that non-equilibrium effects could be identified by inconsistent temperatures of a few eV between the ratios of three or more scattering angles.",

    "abstract": "To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors.

The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\\,\\textmu m, 200\\,\\textmu m and 120\\,\\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5°C and 60°C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model.",

The sensing element is a deep n-well/p-substrate diode without internal amplification. To minimize detector capacitances, the analog front-ends and the discriminators for each pixel have been implemented outside the pixel, at the column level. After fabrication, the sensors have been thinned to 150 microns, 175 microns and 200 microns and then post-processed for backside biasing. The breakdown voltages measured on these sensors are higher than 500 V, ensuring the complete depletion of the charge collection volume. In this paper, we will focus on the time resolution measurements from a test-beam campaign conducted in July 2025 at SPS-CERN. During this period, several pixels from the 3 different sensor thicknesses have been tested at different bias voltages. The best time resolution measured is 48.88 ps on a 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm pixel from a 175 microns-thick sensor at 500 V, with nominal settings for the on-chip analog front-end and discriminator.",

    "title": "SHARP: A compact focusing system for medical applications using a diverging plasma lens",
    "abstract": "Cancer therapy for deep-seated tumors requires precise irradiation of a small target deep within the patient while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. This can be accomplished with a round beam sharply converging towards a single spot, requiring a large beam size in both planes at the exit of the focusing system. Achieving this over a short distance using only quadrupole lenses is challenging; but by using a linear active plasma lens (APL) in defocusing mode, the beam can be quickly and non-destructively enlarged before focusing using quadrupoles. The position of the irradiation spot can also be scanned in three dimensions by changing magnet settings. The SHARP project will develop and test this concept. Such a system can be used with very high energy electrons (hundreds of MeV), creating a Bragg-peak-like spot using novel accelerator technology. This could lead to more compact radiotherapy facilities, not requiring a bulky infrastructure typically associated with proton radiotherapy machines. If successful, SHARP will enable precision conformal radiotherapy, spatial fractionation, and potentially be useful for FLASH radiotherapy.",

The suppression of microturbulence increases the core temperature and subsequently the energy confinement time following the gas puff. The gas injection modifies the radial density profile, making it relatively flatter near the mid-radius. Global electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations show that this modification to the radial density profile due to gas injection suppresses the existing trapped electron mode (TEM). Simulation results show that the TEM-dominated turbulence suppression reduces the turbulence-driven heat transport, leading to an increase in core temperature. Applying multiple periodic gas-puffs leads to multiple periodic events of TEM suppression, improving the overall energy confinement time, and is used as an active control mechanism to influence microturbulence in ADITYA-U tokamak.",

    "title": "Elaboration on the kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko to spin-polarized beams in electron storage rings",
    "abstract": "We present a detailed account of the kinetic approach for describing the effect of synchrotron radiation on electron and positron spin polarization in storage rings. This approach was introduced in 1974 by Derbenev and Kondratenko and was extended by us since 2001. The kinetic approach is much less frequently utilized but it is more general than the original non-kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko from 1972 since the kinetic approach is not centered on the invariant spin field. As with the non-kinetic approach the kinetic approach covers the radiative depolarization effect, the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov correction as well as the kinetic polarization effect but it enables the calculation of corrections to the original Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas and thereby provides estimates of the reliability of the latter. The kinetic approach is applicable to storage rings with energies from a few GeV up to the energies of the FCC-ee and CEPC and beyond. The kinetic approach is based on the spin-orbit Wigner functions which lead to the so-called Bloch equation for the polarization density which is a generalization of Fokker-Planck equations to spin motion. In turn, as discovered in 2019, the Bloch equation is based on stochastic ordinary differential equations which can be used to develop Monte-Carlo spin tracking codes covering the key effects beyond the radiative depolarization effect. These stochastic ordinary differential equations lead to a new viewpoint of the physical effects, in particular the kinetic polarization effect.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.",

    "title": "A Particle-in-Cell Simulation Framework for Thomson Scattering Analysis in Inertial Confinement Fusion",
    "abstract": "In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), Thomson scattering (TS) is a widely used diagnostic technique for probing plasma conditions. We present a first-principles numerical approach to obtaining scattered light signals of ion acoustic features with high resolution in angle and frequency space using particle-in-cell simulations under typical ICF conditions. Our method demonstrates good agreement with existing theories for thermal collective TS. In the super-thermal collective regime, the results align with theory when the driven plasma modes are well-matched in wave vectors to the probe and collecting beams. Moreover, we also find that TS signals can remain significant even under imperfect wave-vector matching-a result that contradicts the conventional expectation that the TS spectrum strictly follows the plasma density spectrum. We attribute this discrepancy to a beating wave mechanism arising from the interaction between the probe beam and driven plasma density modulations. Our work thus provides a practical framework for interpreting TS signals from driven ion modes, a common yet complex feature in ICF plasmas.",

    "title": "Three Dimensional Multiphysics Modelling of Helicon Wave Heating and Antenna Plasma Coupling for Boundary Density Control in Toroidal Fusion Plasmas",
    "abstract": "Active control of scrape off layer density is emerging as a critical requirement for improving ion cyclotron resonance heating and enabling high performance steady state operation in future magnetic confinement fusion devices. Helicon wave excitation offers a promising physics based approach to generating high density boundary plasmas with high ionization efficiency and low impurity release. In this work, we develop THEMIS code, a fully three dimensional (3D) multiphysics model of helicon wave propagation and power deposition in a toroidal fusion relevant configuration, employing a finite temperature thermal dielectric tensor. The code quantifies the relative contributions of Doppler shifted cyclotron damping, anomalous Doppler damping, collisional damping, and Landau damping, and demonstrates that slow wave propagation and electron Landau damping dominate the accessible heating regime in Helimak device. A comparative study of four planar antenna geometries under the present protruding window configuration shows that geometric cutoffs and SOL density gradients severely limit power penetration into the core accessible region. To address this constraint, we introduce a recessed window launch scheme that positions the dielectric window inside the vacuum vessel and perform systematic parameter scans of window position, antenna geometry, and installation orientation. From these analyses, we identify the key physics driven principles governing efficient helicon wave coupling: the importance of open circuit termination, maximized strap length and width, controlled inter turn spacing, and sufficient clearance from metallic walls to avoid near field suppression. Guided by these principles, we designed an optimized racetrack spiral antenna that increases coupling efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared with conventional short circuited rectangular spiral antenna.",

Performance was evaluated at the Bio-REF cold-neutron beamline of the HANARO research reactor using a monochromatic 4.5 {\\angstrom} beam (En = 4.03 meV). The absolute detection efficiency, measured relative to a calibrated Li-6 based Ce:LiCAF scintillation detector, was εBGEM = 8.69 +/- 0.20 % (stat.). The spatial resolution was estimated from the edge smearing of reconstructed images of 1 mm diameter Cd-mask holes via an error-function fit to the radial edge profile, yielding approximately 700 μm. These results demonstrate stable cold-neutron operation of a single converter BGEM detector and provide a baseline for further efficiency improvements via converter and geometry optimization.",

Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \\simeq 3\\times10^{-18},\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\\mathcal{F}\\simeq3.1\\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $ψ_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\approx153^{\\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($φ_p=-85^{\\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($φ_s=0^{\\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($ζ_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\simeq46^{\\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.",

The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\\mathrm{\\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied.

    "abstract": "Proximity effects at superconducting interfaces, between different superconductors (S-S') or between superconductors and normal metals (S-N), are fundamental to the performance of superconducting electronics, yet only few experiments have directly probed the spatial structure of proximity effects within a device. This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations. By providing spatially resolved measurements of the interplay of proximity effects in TES devices, this work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling superconducting states in heterogeneous superconducting structures.",

    "abstract": "VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.",

    "title": "On flying near the base of a pseudo-streamer",
    "abstract": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe encounter 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density (25,000 per cubic centimeter) and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity (200 kilometers per second) and ion temperature (25 electron Volts) were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed near the base of a pseudo-streamer. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.",

    "title": "Magnetic plasmoid explosions in the context of magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts",
    "abstract": "Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events in which intense X and γ-ray emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. The events are also accompanied by mass ejection from the neutron star. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated with flare-type events from magnetars. We provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, magnetic plasmoid explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We find the interdependent relation between pressure, mass density, Lorentz factor, and magnetic field that determines the detailed properties of the solutions. A dichotomy of solutions exists that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. For stronger toroidal magnetic fields, the maximum permitted expansion velocity becomes lower than the weaker toroidal fields. These solution classes can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. Those that corresponding to over densities and higher pressure can be associated with magnetar flares, and those corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts that correspond to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

    "title": "Neoclassical transport and profile prediction in transport barriers",
    "abstract": "Strong gradient regions in tokamaks, such as the pedestal or internal transport barriers, are regions of reduced turbulence where neoclassical transport can play a dominant role. However, standard neoclassical transport theory assumes that the gradient length scales of density, temperature, and potential are of the order of the system size. In the pedestal, gradient length scales are much shorter and are measured to be of the order of the ion poloidal gyroradius. We present an extension of neoclassical theory that is applicable in transport barriers of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that particle and momentum transport are connected in such a way that a source of parallel momentum can drive a significant neoclassical ion particle flux. In strong gradient regions, density, electric potential, mean parallel flow, and ion temperature are shown to no longer be flux functions. Instead, they have a small but important poloidally varying piece that modifies the transport equations to lowest order. This introduces a nonlinearity in the transport problem through the coupling with quasineutrality that yields multiple co-existing solutions when solving for the plasma profiles. The different solutions could be connected to low and high transport states and jumps between solutions could be an indication of H-L back-transitions.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting plasma behavior based on discharge configurations is essential for the safe and efficient operation of tokamak experiments. While physics-based integrated modeling codes provide valuable insights, their high computational cost limits their applicability for fast scenario design and control optimization. In this study, we propose a transformer-based machine learning model to predict key global plasma parameters on the WEST tokamak, including the normalized beta ($β_{n}$), toroidal beta ($β_{t}$), poloidal beta ($β_{p}$), plasma stored energy ($W_{\\mathrm{mhd}}$), safety factor at the magnetic axis ($q_{0}$), and safety factor at the 95% flux surface ($q_{95}$). The model uses only signals that can be defined before the discharge, such as magnetic coil currents, auxiliary heating power, plasma current reference, and line-averaged plasma density. Trained on 550 discharges from the WEST campaigns, the model demonstrates an average mean square error (MSE) loss of 0.026, an average coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ of 0.94, and achieves inference times on the order of 0.1 seconds. These results highlight the potential of data-driven surrogate models for assisting in discharge planning, scenario evaluation, and real-time control of tokamak plasmas.",

    "abstract": "Observations of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope reveal significant inhomogeneities, most likely related to density and magnetic field perturbations. To model these features, we conduct high-resolution 2D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of a Fishbone-Moncrief torus around a Kerr black hole using the Black Hole Accretion Code $\\texttt{BHAC}$. We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/ω$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate. These results provide new insights for interpreting observations of supermassive black hole environments, where near-horizon turbulence may play a key role in the accretion process.",

    "abstract": "High-quality and prebunched electron beams can produce coherent x-rays with high intensity and narrow bandwidth, which is essential for modern light sources. An all-optical scheme based on plasma-based acceleration to produce bright electron beams that are pre-bunched on nanometer-scales is proposed. By using a density modulation created by two low intensity counter-propagating lasers, the phase velocity of the plasma wake excited by an intense driver laser in a uniform plasma can be modulated at a frequency twice that of the colliding lasers and thus turn the injection on and off. The injected electrons are micro-bunched at the Doppler shifted wavelength of the modulated wavelength using the corresponding phase velocity of the gradual expansion of the wakefield. It is demonstrated that by controlling the properties of the drive and colliding lasers, that beams with exotic pre-bunched structures can be produced, which may have critical applications in ultrafast high power x-rays. This extremely compact, all-optical scheme to produce ultra-bright pre-bunched electron beams may therefore enable novel applications for ultrafast x-ray users and arouse general interest in various fields.",

    "title": "How Does The Magnetic Gradient Scale Length Influence Complexity of Filamentary Coils in Stellarators?",
    "abstract": "The distance between the last closed flux surface (LCFS) and the nearest electromagnetic coils is a dominating factor in the cost, size, and engineering difficulty of stellarators. The smallest magnetic gradient scale length on the LCFS - denoted L_gradB - has been shown to be a good proxy for minimum coil-surface distance in optimizations of a current potential on a winding surface, such as through the REGCOIL method. However, it has not been shown the same is true for filament coils, or that the magnetic gradient scale length is an effective objective function in optimization. In this paper, we explore examples in which min(L_gradB) is correlated with the minimum coil-surface distance for filament coils. First, we analyze a subset of the single-stage-optimized equilibria from the QUASR dataset [Giuliani et al. JPP (2024)]. We find that the majority of configurations have min(L_gradB) located nearby the point of closest coil-surface distance. Second, we optimize quasihelically symmetric equilibria to have improved min(L_gradB), and optimize coils via a continuation method. We then traced alpha particles to test confinement. Finally, we compare min(L_gradB) to the minimum coil-surface distance with filament coils optimized for a set of finite beta equilibria with random boundary shapes. For all datasets, we find that min(L_gradB) is correlated with both the minimum coil-surface and coil-coil distances if sufficient coil length is allowed. Even when there is a trade-off with proxies for confinement, optimizing for improved min(L_gradB) can result in better confinement in the presence of coils, up to a point. This is because - when holding coil-coil distance constant - equilibria with lower min(L_gradB) have a larger normal field error dominated by coil ripple causing particle loss. Both can be reduced by increasing coil-surface distance for equilibria with a high min(L_gradB).",

    "title": "Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution",
    "abstract": "This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(θ)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.",

    "title": "Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging",
    "abstract": "The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.",
