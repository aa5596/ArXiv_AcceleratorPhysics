  "title": "Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval",
  "abstract": "The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined with knowledge of the measured z-distance to each measurement plane, we demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast steering mirror and the WFS alone, i.e. without the need for peripheral components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging channel. This approach, which is both precise and accurate, corroborates previous numerical simulations and is expected to improve the overall reconstruction accuracy of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors including higher order spatial modes.",
