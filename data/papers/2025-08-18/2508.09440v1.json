  "title": "Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative   Lightning Flashes",
  "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\\\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward positive lightning pulses and the \"Classical\" and \"Narrow\" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.",
