  "title": "Hamiltonian formulation of the quasineutral Vlasov-Poisson system",
  "abstract": "Slow manifold reduction and the theory of Poisson-Dirac submanifolds are used to deduce a Hamiltonian formulation for a quasineutral limit of the planar, collisionless, magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system. Motion on the slow manifold models plasma dynamics free of fast Langmuir oscillations. Preservation of quasineutrality requires the bulk plasma flow is incompressible. The electric field is determined by counterbalancing plasma stresses that would otherwise produce compression. The Hamiltonian structure for the quasineutral model synthesizes well-known Poisson brackets for incompressible fluids and collisionless kinetic equations.",
