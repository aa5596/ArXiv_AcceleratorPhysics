  "title": "Characteristics of monotonic sheaths near a wall with grazing magnetic   incidence",
  "abstract": "We consider a magnetised plasma in contact with an absorbing planar wall, where the angle $\\alpha$ between the magnetic field and the wall is small, $\\alpha \\ll 1$ (in radians) and the system is symmetric tangential to the wall. The finite ratio $\\gamma$ of the characteristic electron gyroradius $\\rho_{\\rm e}$ to the Debye length $\\lambda_{\\rm D}$, $\\gamma = \\rho_{\\rm e} / \\lambda_{\\rm D}$, is retained via a grazing-incidence ($\\alpha \\ll 1$) gyrokinetic treatment [1,2]. Building on a previously developed iterative scheme [2,3] to solve for the steady-state electrostatic potential in the quasineutral magnetic presheath of width $\\sim \\rho_{\\rm S}$, we developed a scheme that simultaneously solves for both the presheath and the non-neutral Debye sheath of width $\\sim \\lambda_{\\rm D}$ in the limit $\\lambda_{\\rm D} / \\rho_{\\rm S} \\rightarrow 0$. The code, called GYRAZE, thus provides the energy-angle distribution of ions at the wall and the velocity distributions of electrons reflected by the wall for different values of wall potential. A monotonic electrostatic potential profile, assumed in this work, can only exist for magnetic field angles larger than a critical value [3]. While the critical angle is shown here to significantly increase with $\\gamma$, it is still typically smaller than the magnetic field angle at divertor targets of a fusion device.",
