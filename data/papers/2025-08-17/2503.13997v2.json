  "title": "Characterizing Beam Profiles in Accelerator Neutrino Experiments through   Off-Axis Neutrino Interactions",
  "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach that utilizes neutrino events from the off-axis near detector to investigate the beam profile in long-baseline neutrino experiments. Understanding the dynamics of the neutrino beam is crucial for improving the precision of neutrino oscillation measurements. We demonstrate that certain observables related to the azimuthal angle of the neutrino direction are useful for determining the average neutrino production point from experimental data, providing a valuable cross-check against Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, these observables can help identify potential alignment issues between the detector and the decay volume. In future neutrino experiments with significantly higher statistics, these observables will become essential to ensure the accuracy and stability of the beam profile.",
