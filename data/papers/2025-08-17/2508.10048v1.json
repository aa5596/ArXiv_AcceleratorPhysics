  "title": "High-resolution multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer for   exotic nuclei at IGISOL",
  "abstract": "A Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-ToF-MS) has been commissioned at the Ion-Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility. It consists of six electrode pairs that form a nearly energy-isochronous potential and a pulsed drift-tube to trap the ions between the electrodes. Time-of-flight peak widths down to 22 ns full-width at half-maximum and mass-resolving powers of $\\approx 1.5 \\times 10^5$ within 20 ms have been demonstrated. The obtained time-focus and mass-resolving power depend sensitively on the trapping energy, energy spread and the number of revolutions of the ions. The mass-resolving power is affected by the temporal and energy spread of the ions entering the MR-ToF-MS, and fluctuations in the electrode voltages due to temperature variations. The longitudinal emittance corresponding to the temporal and energy spread of $^{39}$K is estimated to be 175 eVns based on the data, close to the expected 186(10) eVns. The time-of-flight temperature sensitivity is found to be -5.55(30) ppm/K. In addition to atomic mass measurements of short-lived exotic nuclides, the MR-ToF-MS can be used as a fast mass separator for various other experiments at IGISOL and as an ion counter for laser spectroscopy and yield measurements.",
