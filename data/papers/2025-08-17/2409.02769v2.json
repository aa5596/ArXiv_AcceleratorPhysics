  "title": "Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition Regime: Spatially-Segregated Structure   of Compressive MHD Turbulence",
  "abstract": "Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{k}}/E_{\\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.",
